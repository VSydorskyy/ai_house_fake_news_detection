95,how to get a breakthrough in ukraine nearly a year after he invaded ukraine russian president vladimir putin has failed to achieve any of his major objectives he has not unified the alleged single slavic nation he has not denazified or demilitarized ukraine and he has not stopped nato expansion instead the ukrainian military kept russian troops out of kyiv defended ukraines secondlargest city kharkiv and launched successful counteroffensives in the fall so that by the end of  it had liberated over  percent of the territory previously captured by russian soldiers that year in january putin removed the general in charge of the war in ukraine sergei surovikin whom he had appointed just a few months earlier wartime leaders change their top generals only when they know they are losingukraine is doing so well in part thanks to the unified western response unlike reactions to russias invasion of georgia in  or ukraine in  the western pushback against putins latest war has been strong along multiple fronts nato enhanced its eastern defenses and invited sweden and finland to join the alliance europe has provided shelter to hundreds of thousands of ukrainian refugees led by the biden administration the west has provided massive amounts of military and economic support at amazing speed levied punishing sanctions and begun a difficult shift away from russian energy even chinese leader xi jinping has offered putin only faint rhetorical support for his war he has not provided russia with weapons and has cautiously avoided violating the global sanctions regimethese are the reasons for optimism the bad news however is that the war continues and putin has shown no signs of wanting to end it instead he is planning a major counteroffensive this year the russians are preparing some  fresh troops general valerii zaluzhnyi the commander in chief of ukraines armed forces warned in december i have no doubt they will have another go at kyiv even though putin must understand by now that ukrainians are willing to fight for as long as it takes to liberate their country he still believes that time is on his side that is because putin expects western governments and societies to lose their will and interest to keep helping ukraine if putin or his aides watch the television personality tucker carlson on fox news or saw the protests last fall in prague their hunch about waning western support would be confirmedif russia starts winning on the battlefield or even fights to a stalemate few will remember us president joe bidens remarkable leadership in galvanizing the world to assist ukraine in  this is why western leaders need to shift how they approach the conflict at this stage incrementally expanding military and economic assistance is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely instead in  the united states nato and the democratic world more broadly should aim to support a breakthrough this means more advanced weapons more sanctions against russia and more economic aid to ukraine none of this should be doled out incrementally it needs to be provided swiftly so that ukraine can win decisively on the battlefield this year without greater and immediate support the war will settle into a stalemate which is only to putins advantage in the end the west will be judged by what happened during the last year of the war not by what happened in the firstthe big bang theorythe most important step the united states and nato allies can take this year is to provide ukraine with weapons that will allow its armed forces to go on the offensive sooner and more successfully in eastern ukraine this year started with much encouraging news the united states france and germany announced plans to provide ukraine with infantry fighting vehicles including m bradleys and strykers amx rcs and marders respectively the united kingdom decided to provide a dozen challenger ii tanks and  as mm selfpropelled howitzers the united states and germany announced plans to give ukraine one battery each of the patriot air defense system and the netherlands pledged to contribute patriot missiles and launchers and finally the united states made the decision last week to provide ukraine a few dozen m abrams tanks which paved the way for germany and other european countries to send the coveted germanmade leopard  tanksthis is a strong way to start the year but our support should not stop there ukraine needs more of everything that has already been supplied it especially needs more high mobility artillery rocket systems himars and more guided multiple launch rocket systems gmlr munitions which have proved so effective on the battlefield if more himars are not available then the united states should send m multiple launch rocket systems the more loitering munitions that can be supplied to ukraine the better the number of tanks announced so far is substantial but still falls multiples short of what the ukrainian military needs to push russian occupiers out of their country especially because the abrams tanks will take many months to be built trained on and deployed ukraine could also use several hundred infantry fighting vehicles which number far surpasses those pledged by the united states and other nato allies in january ukraine could also use more patriot batteries national advanced surfacetoair missile systems and other air defense systemsin addition to greater quantities of weapons the united states and its allies should upgrade the quality of weapons being supplied at the top of this list should be the longrange missile system called atacms it fires missiles that can travel nearly  miles and would thus allow ukrainian forces to attack russian airfields and ammunition sites in crimea and elsewhere that are now out of range and offer sanctuary for russian soldiers using longrange weapons to attack ukrainian towns the provision of longrange strike weapons including the groundlaunched small diameter bomb could be a gamechanger in a ukrainian offensive this spring the ukrainian military also needs much stronger offensive air capabilities including sovietmade mig fighter jets and advanced drones such as the us gray eagle and reaper modelsputin still believes that time is on his sideukrainian pilots also should begin training to fly f fighter jets eventually either in later stages of this war or for enhanced deterrence after the war ukraines air force will need to switch from soviet or russianmade planes to us fighter aircraft in return for receiving these weapons ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy could sign a legally binding agreement to not use these weapons to strike targets inside russiathe way this new military assistance is announced also matters rather than providing atacms in march reapers in june and jets in september nato should go for a big bang plans to provide all these systems should be announced on february   the first anniversary of putins invasion an announcement of this size will produce an important psychological effect inside the kremlin and russian society signaling that the west is committed to ukraines ambition to liberate all occupied territories already kremlin propagandists on television lament that they are fighting a wellarmed and rich nato which has greater resources than russia on february  biden and nato allies could fuel this perception that it would be futile for russia to continue its fightrisk calculussoon after the war began many observers including me worried that putin would view the provision of these kinds of offensive weapons as escalatory and yet after deployment of these major weapons systems putin so far still has not escalated the reason is simple putin has no good way of doing so he is already using very expensive cruise missiles to attack apartment buildings he cannot attack nato lest he risk a broader war that russia would lose quickly that leaves him with only the nuclear option but even that would not serve him well everyone agrees that a nuclear attack against the united states or other nato countries is off the table because mutual assured destruction is still in place the probabilities of putin using a tactical nuclear weapon inside ukraine is also very unlikely as it would serve no obvious battlefield objective it would not stop ukrainians from fighting just the opposite they would recommit to defeating russia and even unleash more attacks including covert operations against targets inside russia using a nuclear weapon in ukraine also would rally greater opposition to the war around the world including in beijing within russian society and maybe even among russias generals obviously ukrainians would suffer most from such an attack and yet they are the ones urging the west not to be deterred by putins nuclear blackmailthere are risks to providing more and better weapons to ukraine but there are also risks to not doing so if the war in ukraine drags on for years so many more peopleukrainians first and foremost but also russianswill die stalemate on the battlefield is a euphemism for continued death and destruction this is the cost of incrementalismprotracted war also risks losing public support in the united states and europe at the end of  biden signed into law a new  billion aid package for ukraine this should fund us military assistance until the end of this year including new weapons systems such as atacms and fighter jets should they be given the green light but now that the house of representatives is under republican control future appropriations could be less forthcoming if the war drags through the end of the year without major ukrainian victories the biden administration will struggle to obtain congressional renewal for a new military and economic assistance package especially as the presidential election heats up with at least one major candidate donald trump who is not a fan of aid to ukraine debate over aid will become fiercer in european capitals too if  results in only minor changes on the battlefield the dangers of incrementalism grow over timetightening the visegovernments supporting ukraine also need to dramatically ratchet up sanctions the united states should lead the way by designating the russian federation a state sponsor of terrorism doing so would first amplify american condemnation of russian terrorist acts in ukraine and other countries but there are also practical effects us citizens and companies would no longer be able to engage in financial transactions with the russian government higher scrutiny would be given to transactions with russian stateowned banks stateowned enterprises and governmentrelated individuals controls over exports reexport and transfer of dualuse items would be strengthenedbut a terrorist designation would not close all loopholes the united states together with other countries in the sanctions coalition should enact fullblocking sanctions on all major russian banks such as gazprombank as well as all stateowned enterprisesall of themincluding rosatom russias stateowned nuclear energy company of course exemptions for the financing of russian exports of food and fertilizer should remain but the west must make it more difficult and therefore more expensive for russian companies to transact with the outside worldnew sanctions must be imposed to cut off all critical technologies helping putins war machine from microprocessors needed to build smart weapons to all forms of imported information technology on which the russian government and economy relies the g should reduce the price cap on russian oil exports further from todays  limit to  a barrel and introduce greater penalties for shipping companies insurance agencies and banks that violate the price cap and they must apply more pressure on us and european companies still doing business in or with russia these companies cannot continue to pay taxes to a terrorist state they must leavethe dangers of incrementalism grow over timeindividual sanctions must be expanded dramatically to include all russian oligarchs still not sanctioned but supporting putin all government officials all top managers and board members of the stateowned enterprises all propagandists advocating for the war all russian soldiers fighting in ukraine and the family members of everyone in these categories sanctioning categories of peopleunited russia party members government officials soldiers and so onand not specific individuals has the added advantage of giving russians the option of resigning as a way to get off the sanctions list at a minimum countries involved in the sanctions regime could start expanding their lists to include everyone already identified by ukraines national agency on corruption prevention as deserving of sanctions countries imposing sanctions also must coordinate their activities so that if a russian is sanctioned in one country that person immediately appears on the sanction list of all countries participating in the sanctions regimenew travel restrictions should also be imposed on all russian citizens a complete travel ban to all democratic countries is one option although it risks alienating russians opposed to the war another is to make all russians wanting to travel to democratic countries pay an additional ukrainian reconstruction fee on top of the cost of their visas if they do not want to pay such a fee for fear that it signals support for ukraine then they can vacation in minsk instead of barcelona the way these new sanctions are announced also matters it is best done all at once by participating countries on february at the same time democracies should make it easier for russians opposed to the war to defect the tens of thousands of russias best and brightest who have already fled should be given work visas to stay in europe and the united states men who fled russia to avoid the draft should be given incentives to not return until the war is over russian opposition leaders and independent journalists living in exile should be able to obtain visas and work permits open bank accounts use credit cards and monetize their youtube channels with much greater ease than can be done todaymoney and messagesukraine needs more money and the west needs to find new ways to provide it the obvious place to start is to transfer the over  billion in russian central bank reserves currently held by the west to the government of ukraine treasury and finance officials in the united states and europe are nervous about such moves but state assets have been seized legally in the past in places such as iraq and afghanistan and it should be done now moreover doing so now has the added advantage of sending a deterrent message to china about invading taiwan as beijing has many more financial reserves invested in the west in addition following the lead of the canadian government frozen assets of russian oligarchs should also be considered for confiscation and transfer to ukraine western countries should impose an import tax on all russian goods and an export tax on all goods and services provided to russia the proceeds of which would be transferred to a ukrainian reconstruction fund and comprehensive planning for the hundreds of billion dollars postwar reconstruction of ukraine should begin todayan effort that should include an international pledging conferenceharsher sanctions work to cut off russia from the world but the west should simultaneously do more to reach the hearts and minds within russia the usgovernmentfunded radio free europeradio liberty nearly tripled its audience most of it in russia and ukraine after the war began russian independent media now operating outside of russia also expanded their audiences viewership of youtube channels operated by colleagues of jailed opposition leader alexei navalny also jumped dramatically in  the two channels navalny originally created have at least  million subscribers but every one of these outlets would benefit from more resources new methods of financing easier access to work visas and technologies to help them penetrate putins informational iron curtain new modalities for reaching russiansbe it through text messaging greater use of tiktok and telegram channels or more subtle cultural messaging rather than direct newsshould be attemptedas long as russian soldiers occupy their country ukrainians will fight they will fight with or without new advanced weapons with or without harsher sanctions with or without money to help them run their country understanding this key insight about the ukrainian mentality today leads to an obvious policy recommendation for the west help ukraine win as fast as possiblethe best way to commemorate february  the anniversary of putins invasion is to make clear that this is the wests strategy this requires a rolloutcoordinated by dozens of countries on the same dayof more and better weapons tougher sanctions new economic assistance greater public diplomacy efforts and a credible commitment to postwar reconstruction this is also the best way to avoid being in the same place when february   rolls around,1

accompanying the military in the russoturkish war of  the tone of the resulting travelogue fluctuates unsettlingly between chatty verbiage and dispassionate horror the circassians hate us pushkin writes at one point we have forced them out of their open grazing lands their aulsvillageshave been devastated whole tribes have been wiped out nine years after his first visit to the caucasus pushkin seems to have gained some clarity on the circassians plight in  the georgian parliament voted to characterize russias actions there as a genocide still in the next sentence he goes on to observe implausibly that circassian babies wield sabres before they can talk later in his account pushkin describes a lunch with troops during which they see on a facing mountainside the ottoman army retreating from russian cossack reinforcementsleaving behind a decapitated and truncated cossack corpse pushkin quickly segues to the congeniality of camp life at dinner we washed down asiatic shashlik with english beer and champagne chilled in the snows of tauridawhat can we afford to see as writers and as readers could pushkin afford to see that he benefitted from the resettlement of the circassians how clearly could he see it for how long at a timeafter lunch kats and i took a funicular to the top of mt mtatsminda where she maintained that tbilisis best custardfilled doughnuts were to be found rising above the treetops thinking back on my own national and global privileges the extent of which have grown clearer to me with the passing years i did not i decided find it difficult to understand pushkins simultaneous ability and inability to perceive the truththe relationship between literary merit and military power is not a delightful subject for contemplation i prefer to think that i would have loved pushkin even if peter and catherine the great hadnt waged extensive foreign and internal wars dragging russia into the european balance of power but would pushkins work still have been translated into english and stocked in the barnes  noble on route  in northern new jerseyin the world superpower to which my parents came in the seventies in pursuit of the best scientific equipment even if it had been translated and i had read it i might not have recognized it as good would it have been goodin tbilisi i remembered a line from oksana zabuzhkos classic  novel fieldwork in ukrainian sex which i read on my  trip to kyiv even if you did by some miracle produce something in this language knocking out goethes faust  zabuzhko writes of ukrainian it would only lie around the libraries unread her narrator an unnamed ukrainianlanguage poet visiting harvard suffers countless indignities shes broke and her work is rarely translated but she refuses to write in english or in russian a selfidentified nationalistmasochist she remains faithful to her forebears poets who hurled themselves like firelogs into the dying embers of the ukrainian with nothing to fucking show for it but mangled destinies and unread bookswere those books unread because they werent as good as pushkinsor was it perhaps the other way round if a book isnt read and doesnt influence other books will it hold less meaning and resonance for future readers conversely can a good book be written without robust literary institutions eugene onegin is clearly a product of pushkins constant dialogue with the editors friends rivals critics and readers whose words surrounded him even in exile nikolai gogol born in  in ukraine with pushkinscale talents became a famous writer only after moving to st petersburggogol now a central figure in the post discourse about russian literature first found critical success in the capital by writing in russian on ukrainian themes but the same critics who praised him also urged him to write about more universalie more russiansubjects gogol duly produced the petersburg tales and part  of dead souls a celebrated literary hostess once asked gogol whether in his soul he was truly russian or ukrainian in response he demanded tell me am i a saint can i really see all my loathsome faults and launched into a tirade about his faults and also other peoples faults he eventually suffered a spiritual breakdown came to believe that his literary works were sinful burned part of his manuscripts possibly including part  of dead souls stopped eating and died in great pain at fortytwothe kremlin now uses gogols work as evidence that ukraine and russia share a single culture an essay about gogols russianness appears on the web site of the russkiy mir foundation which putin started in  according to a  article by putin gogols books are written in russian bristling with malorussianlittle russianfolk sayings and motifs how can this heritage be divided between russia and ukrainein tbilisi the gogol story i kept coming back to was the nose the one where major kovalyov a midlevel civil servant wakes up one morning with no nose fearing for his job and his marriage prospects he hits the streets of st petersburg searching for his missing proboscis a carriage pulls up nearby a personage emerges wearing a uniform and plumed hat that denote a higher rank than kovalyovs it is kovalyovs nose dont you know where you belong kovalyov demands dont you realize you are my own nose the nose coldly replies my dear fellow you are mistaken i am a person in my own rightread enough putin speeches and kovalyovs attitude toward his nose starts to sound familiar how dare a mere appendage masquerade as an independent entity what cruelty to separate the little russian nose from the great russian face in the nose as in so much of the russian literature that i had been revisiting the interests of empire prevail the police apprehend kovalyovs runaway organ just as it was boarding the stagecoach bound for riga tellingly the nose had been headed westthe morning of my lecture i went for a walk on rustaveli avenue the broad treelined sidewalks were flanked with used booksellers purveying alongside georgian books i couldnt read lone volumes of tolstoy and turgenev at one stall a series of sovietera classroom mapsone of them showing the changing eighteenthcentury borders of the russian and ottoman empireswere held in place by a latvian cookbook and a dostoyevsky omnibusdostoyevsky we meet at last i opened it to crime and punishment the story of raskolnikov a poor student who decides to murder an old pawnbroker to fund his education turning the yellowed pages i noticed multiple mentions of napoleon i thought back on raskolnikovs theory about how extraordinary individuals have the right to kill others for the fulfillment of an idea if napoleon who murdered thousands of egyptian people and stole their archeological treasures is lauded as the founder of egyptology why shouldnt a student be able to kill one person to advance his studies the logic of raskolnikovs crime i realized was the logic of imperialismputins offensive on february  owed much to dostoevskyism oksana zabuzhko wrote in an essay last april after the massacre in bucha she called the invasion an explosion of pure distilled evil and longsuppressed hatred and envy adding  why should you live better than us russian soldiers have been saying to ukrainians it was easy to see that message in crime and punishment why should some ridiculous old hag have money when raskolnikov is poordostoyevsky didnt of course endorse raskolnikovs views the clue is in the title the story ends in a siberian prison still he found his ideas interesting enough to be the subject of a book should we still read that book in culture and imperialism edward said raises a similar question about jane austen he concludes that to jettison mansfield park is to miss an opportunity to see literature as a dynamic network rather than as the isolated experiences of victims and perpetratorsbut that the solution isnt to keep consuming austens novels in a geopolitical vacuum instead we need to find new contrapuntal ways of reading that means seeing mansfield park as a book with two geographies one england richly elaborated the other antigua

97,the truth about ukraine and the jews theres a kind of background noisea nasty little music orchestrated by putinist propaganda and its band of useful idiotsits the idea broadly that ukraine at war and martyred is also one of europes most incorrigibly antisemitic countriesso once and for all whats the story with ukraine and antisemitismthe truth is of course that ukraine in the s and s of the th century was a bloodland for jewssoviet ukraine or ukraine sovietized or more precisely ukraine buffeted between sovietism and hitlerism was one of the theaters of the shoah by bullets with counting just the ravines of babi yar  jewish men women and children forced to dig the pits where their warm corpses would be piled still shivering not quite deadand when i say soviet or sovietized its not to minimize the part played in the massacre by compatriots in the countryside or the citiesbut it is to recall that there have been and there are two ukrainesone that was yet to exist as a free and sovereign nation which the ukrainianborn russian poet yevgeny yevtushenko depicted in his requiem to the dead of babi yar as that of the barroom regulars thirsting for the blood of pogroms stinking of vodka and onion and when the victims kicked to the floor begged for mercy encouraging the assassins to beat the yids save russiayes russiaand then another ukraine the one that liberated herself from that russia the one that since the onset of the ussr then the maidan revolution and then the invasion of putins army refuses the status of vassal of the humble twinned servant of the cinderella of the tundra that the invaders drunk on their lebensraum wished to relegate her to and the one that having become this young free country having irrevocably fallen in line with the democracies of europe is

69,tanks alone wont turn the tide of the war in ukraine the most important parts of the package are armored fighting vehicles artillery and precisionguided munitions said michael kofman the russia expert at cna a washington analytic organization the small numbers of tanks promised are the least significant part of thisto ensure ukraines army can conduct such maneuvers will involve an increase in american and european training for months the united states avoided sending ukraine complex new systems that require new training that attitude has shifted  first when the united states sent american artillery then longerrange missile systems and most recently the patriot battery system all of which required training outside ukrainethe initial hesitancy was in part because of concerns about taking experienced ukrainian soldiers off the battlefield as well as worries that having the united states train ukrainian soldiers could be seen by the kremlin as a provocation but with training on patriot missile defense systems underway in oklahoma and instruction on intensive maneuver warfare underway at americas training ground in germany the original concerns have faded us military officials have acknowledgedthis isnt the first time the united states has done this kind of training the united states tried and failed to teach such techniques to the iraqi army and to a lesser degree the afghan military but ukraine has proved itself time and time again to be technically capable and resourceful  and its army has shown itself extremely motivated to learn how to employ new equipmentukrainians have a core professional army group that has been fighting the russians for years and years and years and received western training until  said stephen biddle a professor at columbia university they are not starting from scratchjust how realistic it might be for the pentagon to train the ukrainians in the complexities of combined arms maneuver warfare in a short time span remains to be seen even in peacetime it takes a while for american units to master such operations and thats with the luxury of expansive training areas and deep institutional knowledge still new warfare techniques can be learned under fire after all the american army first learned modern combined arms techniques in the midst of world war iimilitaries that are properly motivated and have the right kind of command structure adapt and learn pretty quickly dr biddle said there is this view out there that militaries never change and thats nonsense they can change really fast when theyre motivated and theyre organized correctly,1
52,the truth about ukraine and the jews theres a kind of background noisea nasty little music orchestrated by putinist propaganda and its band of useful idiotsits the idea broadly that ukraine at war and martyred is also one of europes most incorrigibly antisemitic countriesso once and for all whats the story with ukraine and antisemitismthe truth is of course that ukraine in the s and s of the th century was a bloodland for jewssoviet ukraine or ukraine sovietized or more precisely ukraine buffeted between sovietism and hitlerism was one of the theaters of the shoah by bullets with counting just the ravines of babi yar  jewish men women and children forced to dig the pits where their warm corpses would be piled still shivering not quite deadand when i say soviet or sovietized its not to minimize the part played in the massacre by compatriots in the countryside or the citiesbut it is to recall that there have been and there are two ukrainesone that was yet to exist as a free and sovereign nation which the ukrainianborn russian poet yevgeny yevtushenko depicted in his requiem to the dead of babi yar as that of the barroom regulars thirsting for the blood of pogroms stinking of vodka and onion and when the victims kicked to the floor begged for mercy encouraging the assassins to beat the yids save russiayes russiaand then another ukraine the one that liberated herself from that russia the one that since the onset of the ussr then the maidan revolution and then the invasion of putins army refuses the status of vassal of the humble twinned servant of the cinderella of the tundra that the invaders drunk on their lebensraum wished to relegate her to and the one that having become this young free country having irrevocably fallen in line with the democracies of europe is

23,rereading russian classics in the shadow of the ukraine war as for anna karenina it really does start where onegin ends with a flawlessly dressed heroine married to an influential imperialist the tension between center and periphery is woven into the plot the character of karenin a statesman involved in the resettlement of the subject races turns out to be partly based on pyotr valuev the minister of the interior from  to  valuev oversaw the russian appropriation of bashkir lands around the ural mountainsand also issued a notorious decree restricting the publication of ukrainianlanguage educational and religious texts throughout the empire it reads in part a separate little russian language never existed does not exist and shall not existunlike tatiana anna doesnt remain faithful to her empirebuilding husband she leaves karenin for vronsky who turns down a prestigious military post in tashkent in order to travel with her to italy but the imperial army gets vronsky back in the end that final image of annas lifeless head is actually a flashback vronsky has on his way to join a panslavic volunteer detachment fighting the ottomans in serbia with anna dead and the love plot over his only desire is to end his own life and to kill as many turks as possible in the process to quote a recent think piece titled decolonizing the mysterious soul of the great russian novel by liubov terekhovaa ukrainian critic who was reassessing anna karenina from the united arab emirates as russia bombed her home city kyivrussia is always waging a war where a man can flee in search of deathliterature in short looks different depending on where you read it a subject i found myself discussing one afternoon over lunch in a garden overlooking tbilisi with anna kats a georgianborn russianspeaking scholar of socialist architecture who immigrated to los angeles as a child we talked about the essay can the postsoviet think by madina tlostanova an uzbekcircassian proponent of decoloniality a theory that originated in latin america around the turn of the millennium a key tenet is that thinking is never placeless or disembodied the first principle of thought isnt as descartes said i think therefore i am but i am where i thinki remembered the first time i read pushkins travelogue journey to arzrum the summer i turned twentyduring my own initial foray into travel writing for a student guidebook i had requested an assignment in russia but my russian wasnt good enough so i was sent to turkey to improve my russian i was reading pushkin on night buses feeling excited every time i saw erzurum pushkins arzrum on the schedule board at intercity stationshow to accumulate vast sums of money is the best trick you ever taught me cartoon by frank cotham share share shop shopturkey hadnt been pushkins firstchoice destination eitherhe had wanted to go to paris denied official permission he resolved to leave the country the only way he could think ofby accompanying the military in the russoturkish war of  the tone of the resulting travelogue fluctuates unsettlingly between chatty verbiage and dispassionate horror the circassians hate us pushkin writes at one point we have forced them out of their open grazing lands their aulsvillageshave been devastated whole tribes have been wiped out nine years after his first visit to the caucasus pushkin seems to have gained some clarity on the circassians plight in  the georgian parliament voted to characterize russias actions there as a genocide still in the next sentence he goes on to observe implausibly that circassian babies wield sabres before they can talk later in his account pushkin describes a lunch with troops during which they see on a facing mountainside the ottoman army retreating from russian cossack reinforcementsleaving behind a decapitated and truncated cossack corpse pushkin quickly segues to the congeniality of camp life at dinner we washed down asiatic shashlik with english beer and champagne chilled in the snows of tauridawhat can we afford to see as writers and as readers could pushkin afford to see that he benefitted from the resettlement of the circassians how clearly could he see it for how long at a timeafter lunch kats and i took a funicular to the top of mt mtatsminda where she maintained that tbilisis best custardfilled doughnuts were to be found rising above the treetops thinking back on my own national and global privileges the extent of which have grown clearer to me with the passing years i did not i decided find it difficult to understand pushkins simultaneous ability and inability to perceive the truththe relationship between literary merit and military power is not a delightful subject for contemplation i prefer to think that i would have loved pushkin even if peter and catherine the great hadnt waged extensive foreign and internal wars dragging russia into the european balance of power but would pushkins work still have been translated into english and stocked in the barnes  noble on route  in northern new jerseyin the world superpower to which my parents came in the seventies in pursuit of the best scientific equipment even if it had been translated and i had read it i might not have recognized it as good would it have been goodin tbilisi i remembered a line from oksana zabuzhkos classic  novel fieldwork in ukrainian sex which i read on my  trip to kyiv even if you did by some miracle produce something in this language knocking out goethes faust  zabuzhko writes of ukrainian it would only lie around the libraries unread her narrator an unnamed ukrainianlanguage poet visiting harvard suffers countless indignities shes broke and her work is rarely translated but she refuses to write in english or in russian a selfidentified nationalistmasochist she remains faithful to her forebears poets who hurled themselves like firelogs into the dying embers of the ukrainian with nothing to fucking show for it but mangled destinies and unread bookswere those books unread because they werent as good as pushkinsor was it perhaps the other way round if a book isnt read and doesnt influence other books will it hold less meaning and resonance for future readers conversely can a good book be written without robust literary institutions eugene onegin is clearly a product of pushkins constant dialogue with the editors friends rivals critics and readers whose words surrounded him even in exile nikolai gogol born in  in ukraine with pushkinscale talents became a famous writer only after moving to st petersburggogol now a central figure in the post discourse about russian literature first found critical success in the capital by writing in russian on ukrainian themes but the same critics who praised him also urged him to write about more universalie more russiansubjects gogol duly produced the petersburg tales and part  of dead souls a celebrated literary hostess once asked gogol whether in his soul he was truly russian or ukrainian in response he demanded tell me am i a saint can i really see all my loathsome faults and launched into a tirade about his faults and also other peoples faults he eventually suffered a spiritual breakdown came to believe that his literary works were sinful burned part of his manuscripts possibly including part  of dead souls stopped eating and died in great pain at fortytwothe kremlin now uses gogols work as evidence that ukraine and russia share a single culture an essay about gogols russianness appears on the web site of the russkiy mir foundation which putin started in  according to a  article by putin gogols books are written in russian bristling with malorussianlittle russianfolk sayings and motifs how can this heritage be divided between russia and ukrainein tbilisi the gogol story i kept coming back to was the nose the one where major kovalyov a midlevel civil servant wakes up one morning with no nose fearing for his job and his marriage prospects he hits the streets of st petersburg searching for his missing proboscis a carriage pulls up nearby a personage emerges wearing a uniform and plumed hat that denote a higher rank than kovalyovs it is kovalyovs nose dont you know where you belong kovalyov demands dont you realize you are my own nose the nose coldly replies my dear fellow you are mistaken i am a person in my own rightread enough putin speeches and kovalyovs attitude toward his nose starts to sound familiar how dare a mere appendage masquerade as an independent entity what cruelty to separate the little russian nose from the great russian face in the nose as in so much of the russian literature that i had been revisiting the interests of empire prevail the police apprehend kovalyovs runaway organ just as it was boarding the stagecoach bound for riga tellingly the nose had been headed westthe morning of my lecture i went for a walk on rustaveli avenue the broad treelined sidewalks were flanked with used booksellers purveying alongside georgian books i couldnt read lone volumes of tolstoy and turgenev at one stall a series of sovietera classroom mapsone of them showing the changing eighteenthcentury borders of the russian and ottoman empireswere held in place by a latvian cookbook and a dostoyevsky omnibusdostoyevsky we meet at last i opened it to crime and punishment the story of raskolnikov a poor student who decides to murder an old pawnbroker to fund his education turning the yellowed pages i noticed multiple mentions of napoleon i thought back on raskolnikovs theory about how extraordinary individuals have the right to kill others for the fulfillment of an idea if napoleon who murdered thousands of egyptian people and stole their archeological treasures is lauded as the founder of egyptology why shouldnt a student be able to kill one person to advance his studies the logic of raskolnikovs crime i realized was the logic of imperialismputins offensive on february  owed much to dostoevskyism oksana zabuzhko wrote in an essay last april after the massacre in bucha she called the invasion an explosion of pure distilled evil and longsuppressed hatred and envy adding  why should you live better than us russian soldiers have been saying to ukrainians it was easy to see that message in crime and punishment why should some ridiculous old hag have money when raskolnikov is poordostoyevsky didnt of course endorse raskolnikovs views the clue is in the title the story ends in a siberian prison still he found his ideas interesting enough to be the subject of a book should we still read that book in culture and imperialism edward said raises a similar question about jane austen he concludes that to jettison mansfield park is to miss an opportunity to see literature as a dynamic network rather than as the isolated experiences of victims and perpetratorsbut that the solution isnt to keep consuming austens novels in a geopolitical vacuum instead we need to find new contrapuntal ways of reading that means seeing mansfield park as a book with two geographies one england richly elaborated the other antigua

50,how to get a breakthrough in ukraine nearly a year after he invaded ukraine russian president vladimir putin has failed to achieve any of his major objectives he has not unified the alleged single slavic nation he has not denazified or demilitarized ukraine and he has not stopped nato expansion instead the ukrainian military kept russian troops out of kyiv defended ukraines secondlargest city kharkiv and launched successful counteroffensives in the fall so that by the end of  it had liberated over  percent of the territory previously captured by russian soldiers that year in january putin removed the general in charge of the war in ukraine sergei surovikin whom he had appointed just a few months earlier wartime leaders change their top generals only when they know they are losingukraine is doing so well in part thanks to the unified western response unlike reactions to russias invasion of georgia in  or ukraine in  the western pushback against putins latest war has been strong along multiple fronts nato enhanced its eastern defenses and invited sweden and finland to join the alliance europe has provided shelter to hundreds of thousands of ukrainian refugees led by the biden administration the west has provided massive amounts of military and economic support at amazing speed levied punishing sanctions and begun a difficult shift away from russian energy even chinese leader xi jinping has offered putin only faint rhetorical support for his war he has not provided russia with weapons and has cautiously avoided violating the global sanctions regimethese are the reasons for optimism the bad news however is that the war continues and putin has shown no signs of wanting to end it instead he is planning a major counteroffensive this year the russians are preparing some  fresh troops general valerii zaluzhnyi the commander in chief of ukraines armed forces warned in december i have no doubt they will have another go at kyiv even though putin must understand by now that ukrainians are willing to fight for as long as it takes to liberate their country he still believes that time is on his side that is because putin expects western governments and societies to lose their will and interest to keep helping ukraine if putin or his aides watch the television personality tucker carlson on fox news or saw the protests last fall in prague their hunch about waning western support would be confirmedif russia starts winning on the battlefield or even fights to a stalemate few will remember us president joe bidens remarkable leadership in galvanizing the world to assist ukraine in  this is why western leaders need to shift how they approach the conflict at this stage incrementally expanding military and economic assistance is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely instead in  the united states nato and the democratic world more broadly should aim to support a breakthrough this means more advanced weapons more sanctions against russia and more economic aid to ukraine none of this should be doled out incrementally it needs to be provided swiftly so that ukraine can win decisively on the battlefield this year without greater and immediate support the war will settle into a stalemate which is only to putins advantage in the end the west will be judged by what happened during the last year of the war not by what happened in the firstthe big bang theorythe most important step the united states and nato allies can take this year is to provide ukraine with weapons that will allow its armed forces to go on the offensive sooner and more successfully in eastern ukraine this year started with much encouraging news the united states france and germany announced plans to provide ukraine with infantry fighting vehicles including m bradleys and strykers amx rcs and marders respectively the united kingdom decided to provide a dozen challenger ii tanks and  as mm selfpropelled howitzers the united states and germany announced plans to give ukraine one battery each of the patriot air defense system and the netherlands pledged to contribute patriot missiles and launchers and finally the united states made the decision last week to provide ukraine a few dozen m abrams tanks which paved the way for germany and other european countries to send the coveted germanmade leopard  tanksthis is a strong way to start the year but our support should not stop there ukraine needs more of everything that has already been supplied it especially needs more high mobility artillery rocket systems himars and more guided multiple launch rocket systems gmlr munitions which have proved so effective on the battlefield if more himars are not available then the united states should send m multiple launch rocket systems the more loitering munitions that can be supplied to ukraine the better the number of tanks announced so far is substantial but still falls multiples short of what the ukrainian military needs to push russian occupiers out of their country especially because the abrams tanks will take many months to be built trained on and deployed ukraine could also use several hundred infantry fighting vehicles which number far surpasses those pledged by the united states and other nato allies in january ukraine could also use more patriot batteries national advanced surfacetoair missile systems and other air defense systemsin addition to greater quantities of weapons the united states and its allies should upgrade the quality of weapons being supplied at the top of this list should be the longrange missile system called atacms it fires missiles that can travel nearly  miles and would thus allow ukrainian forces to attack russian airfields and ammunition sites in crimea and elsewhere that are now out of range and offer sanctuary for russian soldiers using longrange weapons to attack ukrainian towns the provision of longrange strike weapons including the groundlaunched small diameter bomb could be a gamechanger in a ukrainian offensive this spring the ukrainian military also needs much stronger offensive air capabilities including sovietmade mig fighter jets and advanced drones such as the us gray eagle and reaper modelsputin still believes that time is on his sideukrainian pilots also should begin training to fly f fighter jets eventually either in later stages of this war or for enhanced deterrence after the war ukraines air force will need to switch from soviet or russianmade planes to us fighter aircraft in return for receiving these weapons ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy could sign a legally binding agreement to not use these weapons to strike targets inside russiathe way this new military assistance is announced also matters rather than providing atacms in march reapers in june and jets in september nato should go for a big bang plans to provide all these systems should be announced on february   the first anniversary of putins invasion an announcement of this size will produce an important psychological effect inside the kremlin and russian society signaling that the west is committed to ukraines ambition to liberate all occupied territories already kremlin propagandists on television lament that they are fighting a wellarmed and rich nato which has greater resources than russia on february  biden and nato allies could fuel this perception that it would be futile for russia to continue its fightrisk calculussoon after the war began many observers including me worried that putin would view the provision of these kinds of offensive weapons as escalatory and yet after deployment of these major weapons systems putin so far still has not escalated the reason is simple putin has no good way of doing so he is already using very expensive cruise missiles to attack apartment buildings he cannot attack nato lest he risk a broader war that russia would lose quickly that leaves him with only the nuclear option but even that would not serve him well everyone agrees that a nuclear attack against the united states or other nato countries is off the table because mutual assured destruction is still in place the probabilities of putin using a tactical nuclear weapon inside ukraine is also very unlikely as it would serve no obvious battlefield objective it would not stop ukrainians from fighting just the opposite they would recommit to defeating russia and even unleash more attacks including covert operations against targets inside russia using a nuclear weapon in ukraine also would rally greater opposition to the war around the world including in beijing within russian society and maybe even among russias generals obviously ukrainians would suffer most from such an attack and yet they are the ones urging the west not to be deterred by putins nuclear blackmailthere are risks to providing more and better weapons to ukraine but there are also risks to not doing so if the war in ukraine drags on for years so many more peopleukrainians first and foremost but also russianswill die stalemate on the battlefield is a euphemism for continued death and destruction this is the cost of incrementalismprotracted war also risks losing public support in the united states and europe at the end of  biden signed into law a new  billion aid package for ukraine this should fund us military assistance until the end of this year including new weapons systems such as atacms and fighter jets should they be given the green light but now that the house of representatives is under republican control future appropriations could be less forthcoming if the war drags through the end of the year without major ukrainian victories the biden administration will struggle to obtain congressional renewal for a new military and economic assistance package especially as the presidential election heats up with at least one major candidate donald trump who is not a fan of aid to ukraine debate over aid will become fiercer in european capitals too if  results in only minor changes on the battlefield the dangers of incrementalism grow over timetightening the visegovernments supporting ukraine also need to dramatically ratchet up sanctions the united states should lead the way by designating the russian federation a state sponsor of terrorism doing so would first amplify american condemnation of russian terrorist acts in ukraine and other countries but there are also practical effects us citizens and companies would no longer be able to engage in financial transactions with the russian government higher scrutiny would be given to transactions with russian stateowned banks stateowned enterprises and governmentrelated individuals controls over exports reexport and transfer of dualuse items would be strengthenedbut a terrorist designation would not close all loopholes the united states together with other countries in the sanctions coalition should enact fullblocking sanctions on all major russian banks such as gazprombank as well as all stateowned enterprisesall of themincluding rosatom russias stateowned nuclear energy company of course exemptions for the financing of russian exports of food and fertilizer should remain but the west must make it more difficult and therefore more expensive for russian companies to transact with the outside worldnew sanctions must be imposed to cut off all critical technologies helping putins war machine from microprocessors needed to build smart weapons to all forms of imported information technology on which the russian government and economy relies the g should reduce the price cap on russian oil exports further from todays  limit to  a barrel and introduce greater penalties for shipping companies insurance agencies and banks that violate the price cap and they must apply more pressure on us and european companies still doing business in or with russia these companies cannot continue to pay taxes to a terrorist state they must leavethe dangers of incrementalism grow over timeindividual sanctions must be expanded dramatically to include all russian oligarchs still not sanctioned but supporting putin all government officials all top managers and board members of the stateowned enterprises all propagandists advocating for the war all russian soldiers fighting in ukraine and the family members of everyone in these categories sanctioning categories of peopleunited russia party members government officials soldiers and so onand not specific individuals has the added advantage of giving russians the option of resigning as a way to get off the sanctions list at a minimum countries involved in the sanctions regime could start expanding their lists to include everyone already identified by ukraines national agency on corruption prevention as deserving of sanctions countries imposing sanctions also must coordinate their activities so that if a russian is sanctioned in one country that person immediately appears on the sanction list of all countries participating in the sanctions regimenew travel restrictions should also be imposed on all russian citizens a complete travel ban to all democratic countries is one option although it risks alienating russians opposed to the war another is to make all russians wanting to travel to democratic countries pay an additional ukrainian reconstruction fee on top of the cost of their visas if they do not want to pay such a fee for fear that it signals support for ukraine then they can vacation in minsk instead of barcelona the way these new sanctions are announced also matters it is best done all at once by participating countries on february at the same time democracies should make it easier for russians opposed to the war to defect the tens of thousands of russias best and brightest who have already fled should be given work visas to stay in europe and the united states men who fled russia to avoid the draft should be given incentives to not return until the war is over russian opposition leaders and independent journalists living in exile should be able to obtain visas and work permits open bank accounts use credit cards and monetize their youtube channels with much greater ease than can be done todaymoney and messagesukraine needs more money and the west needs to find new ways to provide it the obvious place to start is to transfer the over  billion in russian central bank reserves currently held by the west to the government of ukraine treasury and finance officials in the united states and europe are nervous about such moves but state assets have been seized legally in the past in places such as iraq and afghanistan and it should be done now moreover doing so now has the added advantage of sending a deterrent message to china about invading taiwan as beijing has many more financial reserves invested in the west in addition following the lead of the canadian government frozen assets of russian oligarchs should also be considered for confiscation and transfer to ukraine western countries should impose an import tax on all russian goods and an export tax on all goods and services provided to russia the proceeds of which would be transferred to a ukrainian reconstruction fund and comprehensive planning for the hundreds of billion dollars postwar reconstruction of ukraine should begin todayan effort that should include an international pledging conferenceharsher sanctions work to cut off russia from the world but the west should simultaneously do more to reach the hearts and minds within russia the usgovernmentfunded radio free europeradio liberty nearly tripled its audience most of it in russia and ukraine after the war began russian independent media now operating outside of russia also expanded their audiences viewership of youtube channels operated by colleagues of jailed opposition leader alexei navalny also jumped dramatically in  the two channels navalny originally created have at least  million subscribers but every one of these outlets would benefit from more resources new methods of financing easier access to work visas and technologies to help them penetrate putins informational iron curtain new modalities for reaching russiansbe it through text messaging greater use of tiktok and telegram channels or more subtle cultural messaging rather than direct newsshould be attemptedas long as russian soldiers occupy their country ukrainians will fight they will fight with or without new advanced weapons with or without harsher sanctions with or without money to help them run their country understanding this key insight about the ukrainian mentality today leads to an obvious policy recommendation for the west help ukraine win as fast as possiblethe best way to commemorate february  the anniversary of putins invasion is to make clear that this is the wests strategy this requires a rolloutcoordinated by dozens of countries on the same dayof more and better weapons tougher sanctions new economic assistance greater public diplomacy efforts and a credible commitment to postwar reconstruction this is also the best way to avoid being in the same place when february   rolls around,1

the biden administration the west has provided massive amounts of military and economic support at amazing speed levied punishing sanctions and begun a difficult shift away from russian energy even chinese leader xi jinping has offered putin only faint rhetorical support for his war he has not provided russia with weapons and has cautiously avoided violating the global sanctions regimethese are the reasons for optimism the bad news however is that the war continues and putin has shown no signs of wanting to end it instead he is planning a major counteroffensive this year the russians are preparing some  fresh troops general valerii zaluzhnyi the commander in chief of ukraines armed forces warned in december i have no doubt they will have another go at kyiv even though putin must understand by now that ukrainians are willing to fight for as long as it takes to liberate their country he still believes that time is on his side that is because putin expects western governments and societies to lose their will and interest to keep helping ukraine if putin or his aides watch the television personality tucker carlson on fox news or saw the protests last fall in prague their hunch about waning western support would be confirmedif russia starts winning on the battlefield or even fights to a stalemate few will remember us president joe bidens remarkable leadership in galvanizing the world to assist ukraine in  this is why western leaders need to shift how they approach the conflict at this stage incrementally expanding military and economic assistance is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely instead in  the united states nato and the democratic world more broadly should aim to support a breakthrough this means more advanced weapons more sanctions against russia and more economic aid to ukraine none of this should be doled out incrementally it needs to be provided swiftly so that ukraine can win decisively on the battlefield this year without greater and immediate support the war will settle into a stalemate which is only to putins advantage in the end the west will be judged by what happened during the last year of the war not by what happened in the firstthe big bang theorythe most important step the united states and nato allies can take this year is to provide ukraine with weapons that will allow its armed forces to go on the offensive sooner and more successfully in eastern ukraine this year started with much encouraging news the united states france and germany announced plans to provide ukraine with infantry fighting vehicles including m bradleys and strykers amx rcs and marders respectively the united kingdom decided to provide a dozen challenger ii tanks and  as mm selfpropelled howitzers the united states and germany announced plans to give ukraine one battery each of the patriot air defense system and the netherlands pledged to contribute patriot missiles and launchers and finally the united states made the decision last week to provide ukraine a few dozen m abrams tanks which paved the way for germany and other european countries to send the coveted germanmade leopard  tanksthis is a strong way to start the year but our support should not stop there ukraine needs more of everything that has already been supplied it especially needs more high mobility artillery rocket systems himars and more guided multiple launch rocket systems gmlr munitions which have proved so effective on the battlefield if more himars are not available then the united states should send m multiple launch rocket systems the more loitering munitions that can be supplied to ukraine the better the number of tanks announced so far is substantial but still falls multiples short of what the ukrainian military needs to push russian occupiers out of their country especially because the abrams tanks will take many months to be built trained on and deployed ukraine could also use several hundred infantry fighting vehicles which number far surpasses those pledged by the united states and other nato allies in january ukraine could also use more patriot batteries national advanced surfacetoair missile systems and other air defense systemsin addition to greater quantities of weapons the united states and its allies should upgrade the quality of weapons being supplied at the top of this list should be the longrange missile system called atacms it fires missiles that can travel nearly  miles and would thus allow ukrainian forces to attack russian airfields and ammunition sites in crimea and elsewhere that are now out of range and offer sanctuary for russian soldiers using longrange weapons to attack ukrainian towns the provision of longrange strike weapons including the groundlaunched small diameter bomb could be a gamechanger in a ukrainian offensive this spring the ukrainian military also needs much stronger offensive air capabilities including sovietmade mig fighter jets and advanced drones such as the us gray eagle and reaper modelsputin still believes that time is on his sideukrainian pilots also should begin training to fly f fighter jets eventually either in later stages of this war or for enhanced deterrence after the war ukraines air force will need to switch from soviet or russianmade planes to us fighter aircraft in return for receiving these weapons ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy could sign a legally binding agreement to not use these weapons to strike targets inside russiathe way this new military assistance is announced also matters rather than providing atacms in march reapers in june and jets in september nato should go for a big bang plans to provide all these systems should be announced on february   the first anniversary of putins invasion an announcement of this size will produce an important psychological effect inside the kremlin and russian society signaling that the west is committed to ukraines ambition to liberate all occupied territories already kremlin propagandists on television lament that they are fighting a wellarmed and rich nato which has greater resources than russia on february  biden and nato allies could fuel this perception that it would be futile for russia to continue its fightrisk calculussoon after the war began many observers including me worried that putin would view the provision of these kinds of offensive weapons as escalatory and yet after deployment of these major weapons systems putin so far still has not escalated the reason is simple putin has no good way of doing so he is already using very expensive cruise missiles to attack apartment buildings he cannot attack nato lest he risk a broader war that russia would lose quickly that leaves him with only the nuclear option but even that would not serve him well everyone agrees that a nuclear attack against the united states or other nato countries is off the table because mutual assured destruction is still in place the probabilities of putin using a tactical nuclear weapon inside ukraine is also very unlikely as it would serve no obvious battlefield objective it would not stop ukrainians from fighting just the opposite they would recommit to defeating russia and even unleash more attacks including covert operations against targets inside russia using a nuclear weapon in ukraine also would rally greater opposition to the war around the world including in beijing within russian society and maybe even among russias generals obviously ukrainians would suffer most from such an attack and yet they are the ones urging the west not to be deterred by putins nuclear blackmailthere are risks to providing more and better weapons to ukraine but there are also risks to not doing so if the war in ukraine drags on for years so many more peopleukrainians first and foremost but also russianswill die stalemate on the battlefield is a euphemism for continued death and destruction this is the cost of incrementalismprotracted war also risks losing public support in the united states and europe at the end of  biden signed into law a new  billion aid package for ukraine this should fund us military assistance until the end of this year including new weapons systems such as atacms and fighter jets should they be given the green light but now that the house of representatives is under republican control future appropriations could be less forthcoming if the war drags through the end of the year without major ukrainian victories the biden administration will struggle to obtain congressional renewal for a new military and economic assistance package especially as the presidential election heats up with at least one major candidate donald trump who is not a fan of aid to ukraine debate over aid will become fiercer in european capitals too if  results in only minor changes on the battlefield the dangers of incrementalism grow over timetightening the visegovernments supporting ukraine also need to dramatically ratchet up sanctions the united states should lead the way by designating the russian federation a state sponsor of terrorism doing so would first amplify american condemnation of russian terrorist acts in ukraine and other countries but there are also practical effects us citizens and companies would no longer be able to engage in financial transactions with the russian government higher scrutiny would be given to transactions with russian stateowned banks stateowned enterprises and governmentrelated individuals controls over exports reexport and transfer of dualuse items would be strengthenedbut a terrorist designation would not close all loopholes the united states together with other countries in the sanctions coalition should enact fullblocking sanctions on all major russian banks such as gazprombank as well as all stateowned enterprisesall of themincluding rosatom russias stateowned nuclear energy company of course exemptions for the financing of russian exports of food and fertilizer should remain but the west must make it more difficult and therefore more expensive for russian companies to transact with the outside worldnew sanctions must be imposed to cut off all critical technologies helping putins war machine from microprocessors needed to build smart weapons to all forms of imported information technology on which the russian government and economy relies the g should reduce the price cap on russian oil exports further from todays  limit to  a barrel and introduce greater penalties for shipping companies insurance agencies and banks that violate the price cap and they must apply more pressure on us and european companies still doing business in or with russia these companies cannot continue to pay taxes to a terrorist state they must leavethe dangers of incrementalism grow over timeindividual sanctions must be expanded dramatically to include all russian oligarchs still not sanctioned but supporting putin all government officials all top managers and board members of the stateowned enterprises all propagandists advocating for the war all russian soldiers fighting in ukraine and the family members of everyone in these categories sanctioning categories of peopleunited russia party members government officials soldiers and so onand not specific individuals has the added advantage of giving russians the option of resigning as a way to get off the sanctions list at a minimum countries involved in the sanctions regime could start expanding their lists to include everyone already identified by ukraines national agency on corruption prevention as deserving of sanctions countries imposing sanctions also must coordinate their activities so that if a russian is sanctioned in one country that person immediately appears on the sanction list of all countries participating in the sanctions regimenew travel restrictions should also be imposed on all russian citizens a complete travel ban to all democratic countries is one option although it risks alienating russians opposed to the war another is to make all russians wanting to travel to democratic countries pay an additional ukrainian reconstruction fee on top of the cost of their visas if they do not want to pay such a fee for fear that it signals support for ukraine then they can vacation in minsk instead of barcelona the way these new sanctions are announced also matters it is best done all at once by participating countries on february at the same time democracies should make it easier for russians opposed to the war to defect the tens of thousands of russias best and brightest who have already fled should be given work visas to stay in europe and the united states men who fled russia to avoid the draft should be given incentives to not return until the war is over russian opposition leaders and independent journalists living in exile should be able to obtain visas and work permits open bank accounts use credit cards and monetize their youtube channels with much greater ease than can be done todaymoney and messagesukraine needs more money and the west needs to find new ways to provide it the obvious place to start is to transfer the over  billion in russian central bank reserves currently held by the west to the government of ukraine treasury and finance officials in the united states and europe are nervous about such moves but state assets have been seized legally in the past in places such as iraq and afghanistan and it should be done now moreover doing so now has the added advantage of sending a deterrent message to china about invading taiwan as beijing has many more financial reserves invested in the west in addition following the lead of the canadian government frozen assets of russian oligarchs should also be considered for confiscation and transfer to ukraine western countries should impose an import tax on all russian goods and an export tax on all goods and services provided to russia the proceeds of which would be transferred to a ukrainian reconstruction fund and comprehensive planning for the hundreds of billion dollars postwar reconstruction of ukraine should begin todayan effort that should include an international pledging conferenceharsher sanctions work to cut off russia from the world but the west should simultaneously do more to reach the hearts and minds within russia the usgovernmentfunded radio free europeradio liberty nearly tripled its audience most of it in russia and ukraine after the war began russian independent media now operating outside of russia also expanded their audiences viewership of youtube channels operated by colleagues of jailed opposition leader alexei navalny also jumped dramatically in  the two channels navalny originally created have at least  million subscribers but every one of these outlets would benefit from more resources new methods of financing easier access to work visas and technologies to help them penetrate putins informational iron curtain new modalities for reaching russiansbe it through text messaging greater use of tiktok and telegram channels or more subtle cultural messaging rather than direct newsshould be attemptedas long as russian soldiers occupy their country ukrainians will fight they will fight with or without new advanced weapons with or without harsher sanctions with or without money to help them run their country understanding this key insight about the ukrainian mentality today leads to an obvious policy recommendation for the west help ukraine win as fast as possiblethe best way to commemorate february  the anniversary of putins invasion is to make clear that this is the wests strategy this requires a rolloutcoordinated by dozens of countries on the same dayof more and better weapons tougher sanctions new economic assistance greater public diplomacy efforts and a credible commitment to postwar reconstruction this is also the best way to avoid being in the same place when february   rolls around,1

7,the truth about ukraine and the jews theres a kind of background noisea nasty little music orchestrated by putinist propaganda and its band of useful idiotsits the idea broadly that ukraine at war and martyred is also one of europes most incorrigibly antisemitic countriesso once and for all whats the story with ukraine and antisemitismthe truth is of course that ukraine in the s and s of the th century was a bloodland for jewssoviet ukraine or ukraine sovietized or more precisely ukraine buffeted between sovietism and hitlerism was one of the theaters of the shoah by bullets with counting just the ravines of babi yar  jewish men women and children forced to dig the pits where their warm corpses would be piled still shivering not quite deadand when i say soviet or sovietized its not to minimize the part played in the massacre by compatriots in the countryside or the citiesbut it is to recall that there have been and there are two ukrainesone that was yet to exist as a free and sovereign nation which the ukrainianborn russian poet yevgeny yevtushenko depicted in his requiem to the dead of babi yar as that of the barroom regulars thirsting for the blood of pogroms stinking of vodka and onion and when the victims kicked to the floor begged for mercy encouraging the assassins to beat the yids save russiayes russiaand then another ukraine the one that liberated herself from that russia the one that since the onset of the ussr then the maidan revolution and then the invasion of putins army refuses the status of vassal of the humble twinned servant of the cinderella of the tundra that the invaders drunk on their lebensraum wished to relegate her to and the one that having become this young free country having irrevocably fallen in line with the democracies of europe is

flee in search of deathliterature in short looks different depending on where you read it a subject i found myself discussing one afternoon over lunch in a garden overlooking tbilisi with anna kats a georgianborn russianspeaking scholar of socialist architecture who immigrated to los angeles as a child we talked about the essay can the postsoviet think by madina tlostanova an uzbekcircassian proponent of decoloniality a theory that originated in latin america around the turn of the millennium a key tenet is that thinking is never placeless or disembodied the first principle of thought isnt as descartes said i think therefore i am but i am where i thinki remembered the first time i read pushkins travelogue journey to arzrum the summer i turned twentyduring my own initial foray into travel writing for a student guidebook i had requested an assignment in russia but my russian wasnt good enough so i was sent to turkey to improve my russian i was reading pushkin on night buses feeling excited every time i saw erzurum pushkins arzrum on the schedule board at intercity stationshow to accumulate vast sums of money is the best trick you ever taught me cartoon by frank cotham share share shop shopturkey hadnt been pushkins firstchoice destination eitherhe had wanted to go to paris denied official permission he resolved to leave the country the only way he could think ofby accompanying the military in the russoturkish war of  the tone of the resulting travelogue fluctuates unsettlingly between chatty verbiage and dispassionate horror the circassians hate us pushkin writes at one point we have forced them out of their open grazing lands their aulsvillageshave been devastated whole tribes have been wiped out nine years after his first visit to the caucasus pushkin seems to have gained some clarity on the circassians plight in  the georgian parliament voted to characterize russias actions there as a genocide still in the next sentence he goes on to observe implausibly that circassian babies wield sabres before they can talk later in his account pushkin describes a lunch with troops during which they see on a facing mountainside the ottoman army retreating from russian cossack reinforcementsleaving behind a decapitated and truncated cossack corpse pushkin quickly segues to the congeniality of camp life at dinner we washed down asiatic shashlik with english beer and champagne chilled in the snows of tauridawhat can we afford to see as writers and as readers could pushkin afford to see that he benefitted from the resettlement of the circassians how clearly could he see it for how long at a timeafter lunch kats and i took a funicular to the top of mt mtatsminda where she maintained that tbilisis best custardfilled doughnuts were to be found rising above the treetops thinking back on my own national and global privileges the extent of which have grown clearer to me with the passing years i did not i decided find it difficult to understand pushkins simultaneous ability and inability to perceive the truththe relationship between literary merit and military power is not a delightful subject for contemplation i prefer to think that i would have loved pushkin even if peter and catherine the great hadnt waged extensive foreign and internal wars dragging russia into the european balance of power but would pushkins work still have been translated into english and stocked in the barnes  noble on route  in northern new jerseyin the world superpower to which my parents came in the seventies in pursuit of the best scientific equipment even if it had been translated and i had read it i might not have recognized it as good would it have been goodin tbilisi i remembered a line from oksana zabuzhkos classic  novel fieldwork in ukrainian sex which i read on my  trip to kyiv even if you did by some miracle produce something in this language knocking out goethes faust  zabuzhko writes of ukrainian it would only lie around the libraries unread her narrator an unnamed ukrainianlanguage poet visiting harvard suffers countless indignities shes broke and her work is rarely translated but she refuses to write in english or in russian a selfidentified nationalistmasochist she remains faithful to her forebears poets who hurled themselves like firelogs into the dying embers of the ukrainian with nothing to fucking show for it but mangled destinies and unread bookswere those books unread because they werent as good as pushkinsor was it perhaps the other way round if a book isnt read and doesnt influence other books will it hold less meaning and resonance for future readers conversely can a good book be written without robust literary institutions eugene onegin is clearly a product of pushkins constant dialogue with the editors friends rivals critics and readers whose words surrounded him even in exile nikolai gogol born in  in ukraine with pushkinscale talents became a famous writer only after moving to st petersburggogol now a central figure in the post discourse about russian literature first found critical success in the capital by writing in russian on ukrainian themes but the same critics who praised him also urged him to write about more universalie more russiansubjects gogol duly produced the petersburg tales and part  of dead souls a celebrated literary hostess once asked gogol whether in his soul he was truly russian or ukrainian in response he demanded tell me am i a saint can i really see all my loathsome faults and launched into a tirade about his faults and also other peoples faults he eventually suffered a spiritual breakdown came to believe that his literary works were sinful burned part of his manuscripts possibly including part  of dead souls stopped eating and died in great pain at fortytwothe kremlin now uses gogols work as evidence that ukraine and russia share a single culture an essay about gogols russianness appears on the web site of the russkiy mir foundation which putin started in  according to a  article by putin gogols books are written in russian bristling with malorussianlittle russianfolk sayings and motifs how can this heritage be divided between russia and ukrainein tbilisi the gogol story i kept coming back to was the nose the one where major kovalyov a midlevel civil servant wakes up one morning with no nose fearing for his job and his marriage prospects he hits the streets of st petersburg searching for his missing proboscis a carriage pulls up nearby a personage emerges wearing a uniform and plumed hat that denote a higher rank than kovalyovs it is kovalyovs nose dont you know where you belong kovalyov demands dont you realize you are my own nose the nose coldly replies my dear fellow you are mistaken i am a person in my own rightread enough putin speeches and kovalyovs attitude toward his nose starts to sound familiar how dare a mere appendage masquerade as an independent entity what cruelty to separate the little russian nose from the great russian face in the nose as in so much of the russian literature that i had been revisiting the interests of empire prevail the police apprehend kovalyovs runaway organ just as it was boarding the stagecoach bound for riga tellingly the nose had been headed westthe morning of my lecture i went for a walk on rustaveli avenue the broad treelined sidewalks were flanked with used booksellers purveying alongside georgian books i couldnt read lone volumes of tolstoy and turgenev at one stall a series of sovietera classroom mapsone of them showing the changing eighteenthcentury borders of the russian and ottoman empireswere held in place by a latvian cookbook and a dostoyevsky omnibusdostoyevsky we meet at last i opened it to crime and punishment the story of raskolnikov a poor student who decides to murder an old pawnbroker to fund his education turning the yellowed pages i noticed multiple mentions of napoleon i thought back on raskolnikovs theory about how extraordinary individuals have the right to kill others for the fulfillment of an idea if napoleon who murdered thousands of egyptian people and stole their archeological treasures is lauded as the founder of egyptology why shouldnt a student be able to kill one person to advance his studies the logic of raskolnikovs crime i realized was the logic of imperialismputins offensive on february  owed much to dostoevskyism oksana zabuzhko wrote in an essay last april after the massacre in bucha she called the invasion an explosion of pure distilled evil and longsuppressed hatred and envy adding  why should you live better than us russian soldiers have been saying to ukrainians it was easy to see that message in crime and punishment why should some ridiculous old hag have money when raskolnikov is poordostoyevsky didnt of course endorse raskolnikovs views the clue is in the title the story ends in a siberian prison still he found his ideas interesting enough to be the subject of a book should we still read that book in culture and imperialism edward said raises a similar question about jane austen he concludes that to jettison mansfield park is to miss an opportunity to see literature as a dynamic network rather than as the isolated experiences of victims and perpetratorsbut that the solution isnt to keep consuming austens novels in a geopolitical vacuum instead we need to find new contrapuntal ways of reading that means seeing mansfield park as a book with two geographies one england richly elaborated the other antigua

and punishment the story of raskolnikov a poor student who decides to murder an old pawnbroker to fund his education turning the yellowed pages i noticed multiple mentions of napoleon i thought back on raskolnikovs theory about how extraordinary individuals have the right to kill others for the fulfillment of an idea if napoleon who murdered thousands of egyptian people and stole their archeological treasures is lauded as the founder of egyptology why shouldnt a student be able to kill one person to advance his studies the logic of raskolnikovs crime i realized was the logic of

ridiculous old hag have money when raskolnikov is poordostoyevsky didnt of course endorse raskolnikovs views the clue is in the title the story ends in a siberian prison still he found his ideas

5,how to get a breakthrough in ukraine nearly a year after he invaded ukraine russian president vladimir putin has failed to achieve any of his major objectives he has not unified the alleged single slavic nation he has not denazified or demilitarized ukraine and he has not stopped nato expansion instead the ukrainian military kept russian troops out of kyiv defended ukraines secondlargest city kharkiv and launched successful counteroffensives in the fall so that by the end of  it had liberated over  percent of the territory previously captured by russian soldiers that year in january putin removed the general in charge of the war in ukraine sergei surovikin whom he had appointed just a few months earlier wartime leaders change their top generals only when they know they are losingukraine is doing so well in part thanks to the unified western response unlike reactions to russias invasion of georgia in  or ukraine in  the western pushback against putins latest war has been strong along multiple fronts nato enhanced its eastern defenses and invited sweden and finland to join the alliance europe has provided shelter to hundreds of thousands of ukrainian refugees led by the biden administration the west has provided massive amounts of military and economic support at amazing speed levied punishing sanctions and begun a difficult shift away from russian energy even chinese leader xi jinping has offered putin only faint rhetorical support for his war he has not provided russia with weapons and has cautiously avoided violating the global sanctions regimethese are the reasons for optimism the bad news however is that the war continues and putin has shown no signs of wanting to end it instead he is planning a major counteroffensive this year the russians are preparing some  fresh troops general valerii zaluzhnyi the commander in chief of ukraines armed forces warned in december i have no doubt they will have another go at kyiv even though putin must understand by now that ukrainians are willing to fight for as long as it takes to liberate their country he still believes that time is on his side that is because putin expects western governments and societies to lose their will and interest to keep helping ukraine if putin or his aides watch the television personality tucker carlson on fox news or saw the protests last fall in prague their hunch about waning western support would be confirmedif russia starts winning on the battlefield or even fights to a stalemate few will remember us president joe bidens remarkable leadership in galvanizing the world to assist ukraine in  this is why western leaders need to shift how they approach the conflict at this stage incrementally expanding military and economic assistance is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely instead in  the united states nato and the democratic world more broadly should aim to support a breakthrough this means more advanced weapons more sanctions against russia and more economic aid to ukraine none of this should be doled out incrementally it needs to be provided swiftly so that ukraine can win decisively on the battlefield this year without greater and immediate support the war will settle into a stalemate which is only to putins advantage in the end the west will be judged by what happened during the last year of the war not by what happened in the firstthe big bang theorythe most important step the united states and nato allies can take this year is to provide ukraine with weapons that will allow its armed forces to go on the offensive sooner and more successfully in eastern ukraine this year started with much encouraging news the united states france and germany announced plans to provide ukraine with infantry fighting vehicles including m bradleys and strykers amx rcs and marders respectively the united kingdom decided to provide a dozen challenger ii tanks and  as mm selfpropelled howitzers the united states and germany announced plans to give ukraine one battery each of the patriot air defense system and the netherlands pledged to contribute patriot missiles and launchers and finally the united states made the decision last week to provide ukraine a few dozen m abrams tanks which paved the way for germany and other european countries to send the coveted germanmade leopard  tanksthis is a strong way to start the year but our support should not stop there ukraine needs more of everything that has already been supplied it especially needs more high mobility artillery rocket systems himars and more guided multiple launch rocket systems gmlr munitions which have proved so effective on the battlefield if more himars are not available then the united states should send m multiple launch rocket systems the more loitering munitions that can be supplied to ukraine the better the number of tanks announced so far is substantial but still falls multiples short of what the ukrainian military needs to push russian occupiers out of their country especially because the abrams tanks will take many months to be built trained on and deployed ukraine could also use several hundred infantry fighting vehicles which number far surpasses those pledged by the united states and other nato allies in january ukraine could also use more patriot batteries national advanced surfacetoair missile systems and other air defense systemsin addition to greater quantities of weapons the united states and its allies should upgrade the quality of weapons being supplied at the top of this list should be the longrange missile system called atacms it fires missiles that can travel nearly  miles and would thus allow ukrainian forces to attack russian airfields and ammunition sites in crimea and elsewhere that are now out of range and offer sanctuary for russian soldiers using longrange weapons to attack ukrainian towns the provision of longrange strike weapons including the groundlaunched small diameter bomb could be a gamechanger in a ukrainian offensive this spring the ukrainian military also needs much stronger offensive air capabilities including sovietmade mig fighter jets and advanced drones such as the us gray eagle and reaper modelsputin still believes that time is on his sideukrainian pilots also should begin training to fly f fighter jets eventually either in later stages of this war or for enhanced deterrence after the war ukraines air force will need to switch from soviet or russianmade planes to us fighter aircraft in return for receiving these weapons ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy could sign a legally binding agreement to not use these weapons to strike targets inside russiathe way this new military assistance is announced also matters rather than providing atacms in march reapers in june and jets in september nato should go for a big bang plans to provide all these systems should be announced on february   the first anniversary of putins invasion an announcement of this size will produce an important psychological effect inside the kremlin and russian society signaling that the west is committed to ukraines ambition to liberate all occupied territories already kremlin propagandists on television lament that they are fighting a wellarmed and rich nato which has greater resources than russia on february  biden and nato allies could fuel this perception that it would be futile for russia to continue its fightrisk calculussoon after the war began many observers including me worried that putin would view the provision of these kinds of offensive weapons as escalatory and yet after deployment of these major weapons systems putin so far still has not escalated the reason is simple putin has no good way of doing so he is already using very expensive cruise missiles to attack apartment buildings he cannot attack nato lest he risk a broader war that russia would lose quickly that leaves him with only the nuclear option but even that would not serve him well everyone agrees that a nuclear attack against the united states or other nato countries is off the table because mutual assured destruction is still in place the probabilities of putin using a tactical nuclear weapon inside ukraine is also very unlikely as it would serve no obvious battlefield objective it would not stop ukrainians from fighting just the opposite they would recommit to defeating russia and even unleash more attacks including covert operations against targets inside russia using a nuclear weapon in ukraine also would rally greater opposition to the war around the world including in beijing within russian society and maybe even among russias generals obviously ukrainians would suffer most from such an attack and yet they are the ones urging the west not to be deterred by putins nuclear blackmailthere are risks to providing more and better weapons to ukraine but there are also risks to not doing so if the war in ukraine drags on for years so many more peopleukrainians first and foremost but also russianswill die stalemate on the battlefield is a euphemism for continued death and destruction this is the cost of incrementalismprotracted war also risks losing public support in the united states and europe at the end of  biden signed into law a new  billion aid package for ukraine this should fund us military assistance until the end of this year including new weapons systems such as atacms and fighter jets should they be given the green light but now that the house of representatives is under republican control future appropriations could be less forthcoming if the war drags through the end of the year without major ukrainian victories the biden administration will struggle to obtain congressional renewal for a new military and economic assistance package especially as the presidential election heats up with at least one major candidate donald trump who is not a fan of aid to ukraine debate over aid will become fiercer in european capitals too if  results in only minor changes on the battlefield the dangers of incrementalism grow over timetightening the visegovernments supporting ukraine also need to dramatically ratchet up sanctions the united states should lead the way by designating the russian federation a state sponsor of terrorism doing so would first amplify american condemnation of russian terrorist acts in ukraine and other countries but there are also practical effects us citizens and companies would no longer be able to engage in financial transactions with the russian government higher scrutiny would be given to transactions with russian stateowned banks stateowned enterprises and governmentrelated individuals controls over exports reexport and transfer of dualuse items would be strengthenedbut a terrorist designation would not close all loopholes the united states together with other countries in the sanctions coalition should enact fullblocking sanctions on all major russian banks such as gazprombank as well as all stateowned enterprisesall of themincluding rosatom russias stateowned nuclear energy company of course exemptions for the financing of russian exports of food and fertilizer should remain but the west must make it more difficult and therefore more expensive for russian companies to transact with the outside worldnew sanctions must be imposed to cut off all critical technologies helping putins war machine from microprocessors needed to build smart weapons to all forms of imported information technology on which the russian government and economy relies the g should reduce the price cap on russian oil exports further from todays  limit to  a barrel and introduce greater penalties for shipping companies insurance agencies and banks that violate the price cap and they must apply more pressure on us and european companies still doing business in or with russia these companies cannot continue to pay taxes to a terrorist state they must leavethe dangers of incrementalism grow over timeindividual sanctions must be expanded dramatically to include all russian oligarchs still not sanctioned but supporting putin all government officials all top managers and board members of the stateowned enterprises all propagandists advocating for the war all russian soldiers fighting in ukraine and the family members of everyone in these categories sanctioning categories of peopleunited russia party members government officials soldiers and so onand not specific individuals has the added advantage of giving russians the option of resigning as a way to get off the sanctions list at a minimum countries involved in the sanctions regime could start expanding their lists to include everyone already identified by ukraines national agency on corruption prevention as deserving of sanctions countries imposing sanctions also must coordinate their activities so that if a russian is sanctioned in one country that person immediately appears on the sanction list of all countries participating in the sanctions regimenew travel restrictions should also be imposed on all russian citizens a complete travel ban to all democratic countries is one option although it risks alienating russians opposed to the war another is to make all russians wanting to travel to democratic countries pay an additional ukrainian reconstruction fee on top of the cost of their visas if they do not want to pay such a fee for fear that it signals support for ukraine then they can vacation in minsk instead of barcelona the way these new sanctions are announced also matters it is best done all at once by participating countries on february at the same time democracies should make it easier for russians opposed to the war to defect the tens of thousands of russias best and brightest who have already fled should be given work visas to stay in europe and the united states men who fled russia to avoid the draft should be given incentives to not return until the war is over russian opposition leaders and independent journalists living in exile should be able to obtain visas and work permits open bank accounts use credit cards and monetize their youtube channels with much greater ease than can be done todaymoney and messagesukraine needs more money and the west needs to find new ways to provide it the obvious place to start is to transfer the over  billion in russian central bank reserves currently held by the west to the government of ukraine treasury and finance officials in the united states and europe are nervous about such moves but state assets have been seized legally in the past in places such as iraq and afghanistan and it should be done now moreover doing so now has the added advantage of sending a deterrent message to china about invading taiwan as beijing has many more financial reserves invested in the west in addition following the lead of the canadian government frozen assets of russian oligarchs should also be considered for confiscation and transfer to ukraine western countries should impose an import tax on all russian goods and an export tax on all goods and services provided to russia the proceeds of which would be transferred to a ukrainian reconstruction fund and comprehensive planning for the hundreds of billion dollars postwar reconstruction of ukraine should begin todayan effort that should include an international pledging conferenceharsher sanctions work to cut off russia from the world but the west should simultaneously do more to reach the hearts and minds within russia the usgovernmentfunded radio free europeradio liberty nearly tripled its audience most of it in russia and ukraine after the war began russian independent media now operating outside of russia also expanded their audiences viewership of youtube channels operated by colleagues of jailed opposition leader alexei navalny also jumped dramatically in  the two channels navalny originally created have at least  million subscribers but every one of these outlets would benefit from more resources new methods of financing easier access to work visas and technologies to help them penetrate putins informational iron curtain new modalities for reaching russiansbe it through text messaging greater use of tiktok and telegram channels or more subtle cultural messaging rather than direct newsshould be attemptedas long as russian soldiers occupy their country ukrainians will fight they will fight with or without new advanced weapons with or without harsher sanctions with or without money to help them run their country understanding this key insight about the ukrainian mentality today leads to an obvious policy recommendation for the west help ukraine win as fast as possiblethe best way to commemorate february  the anniversary of putins invasion is to make clear that this is the wests strategy this requires a rolloutcoordinated by dozens of countries on the same dayof more and better weapons tougher sanctions new economic assistance greater public diplomacy efforts and a credible commitment to postwar reconstruction this is also the best way to avoid being in the same place when february   rolls around,1

managers and board members of the stateowned enterprises all propagandists advocating for the war all russian soldiers fighting in ukraine and the family members of everyone in these categories sanctioning categories of peopleunited russia party members government officials soldiers and so onand not specific individuals has the added advantage of giving russians the option of resigning as a way to get off the sanctions list at a minimum countries involved in the sanctions regime could start expanding their lists to include everyone already identified by ukraines national agency on corruption prevention as deserving of sanctions countries imposing sanctions also must coordinate their activities so that if a russian is sanctioned in one country that person immediately appears on the sanction list of all countries participating in the sanctions regimenew travel restrictions should also be imposed on all russian citizens a complete travel ban to all democratic countries is one option although it risks alienating russians opposed to the war another is to make all russians wanting to travel to democratic countries pay an additional ukrainian reconstruction fee on top of the cost of their visas if they do not want to pay such a fee for fear that it signals support for ukraine then they can vacation in minsk instead of barcelona the way these new sanctions are announced also matters it is best done all at once by participating countries on february at the same time democracies should make it easier for russians opposed to the war to defect the tens of thousands of russias best and brightest who have already fled should be given work visas to stay in europe and the united states men who fled russia to avoid the draft should be given incentives to not return until the war is over russian opposition leaders and independent journalists living in exile should be able to obtain visas and work permits open bank accounts use credit cards and monetize their youtube channels with much greater ease than can be done todaymoney and messagesukraine needs more money and the west needs to find new ways to provide it the obvious place to start is to transfer the over  billion in russian central bank reserves currently held by the west to the government of ukraine treasury and finance officials in the united states and europe are nervous about such moves but state assets have been seized legally in the past in places such as iraq and afghanistan and it should be done now moreover doing so now has the added advantage of sending a deterrent message to china about invading taiwan as beijing has many more financial reserves invested in the west in addition following the lead of the canadian government frozen assets of russian oligarchs should also be considered for confiscation and transfer to ukraine western countries should impose an import tax on all russian goods and an export tax on all goods and services provided to russia the proceeds of which would be transferred to a ukrainian reconstruction fund and comprehensive planning for the hundreds of billion dollars postwar reconstruction of ukraine should begin todayan effort that should include an international pledging conferenceharsher sanctions work to cut off russia from the world but the west should simultaneously do more to reach the hearts and minds within russia the usgovernmentfunded radio free europeradio liberty nearly tripled its audience most of it in russia and ukraine after the war began russian independent media now operating outside of russia also expanded their audiences viewership of youtube channels operated by colleagues of jailed opposition leader alexei navalny also jumped dramatically in  the two channels navalny originally created have at least  million subscribers but every one of these outlets would benefit from more resources new methods of financing easier access to work visas and technologies to help them penetrate putins informational iron curtain new modalities for reaching russiansbe it through text messaging greater use of tiktok and telegram channels or more subtle cultural messaging rather than direct newsshould be attemptedas long as russian soldiers occupy their country ukrainians will fight they will fight with or without new advanced weapons with or without harsher sanctions with or without money to help them run their country understanding this key insight about the ukrainian mentality today leads to an obvious policy recommendation for the west help ukraine win as fast as possiblethe best way to commemorate february  the anniversary of putins invasion is to make clear that this is the wests strategy this requires a rolloutcoordinated by dozens of countries on the same dayof more and better weapons tougher sanctions new economic assistance greater public diplomacy efforts and a credible commitment to postwar reconstruction this is also the best way to avoid being in the same place when february   rolls around,1

35,how to get a breakthrough in ukraine nearly a year after he invaded ukraine russian president vladimir putin has failed to achieve any of his major objectives he has not unified the alleged single slavic nation he has not denazified or demilitarized ukraine and he has not stopped nato expansion instead the ukrainian military kept russian troops out of kyiv defended ukraines secondlargest city kharkiv and launched successful counteroffensives in the fall so that by the end of  it had liberated over  percent of the territory previously captured by russian soldiers that year in january putin removed the general in charge of the war in ukraine sergei surovikin whom he had appointed just a few months earlier wartime leaders change their top generals only when they know they are losingukraine is doing so well in part thanks to the unified western response unlike reactions to russias invasion of georgia in  or ukraine in  the western pushback against putins latest war has been strong along multiple fronts nato enhanced its eastern defenses and invited sweden and finland to join the alliance europe has provided shelter to hundreds of thousands of ukrainian refugees led by the biden administration the west has provided massive amounts of military and economic support at amazing speed levied punishing sanctions and begun a difficult shift away from russian energy even chinese leader xi jinping has offered putin only faint rhetorical support for his war he has not provided russia with weapons and has cautiously avoided violating the global sanctions regimethese are the reasons for optimism the bad news however is that the war continues and putin has shown no signs of wanting to end it instead he is planning a major counteroffensive this year the russians are preparing some  fresh troops general valerii zaluzhnyi the commander in chief of ukraines armed forces warned in december i have no doubt they will have another go at kyiv even though putin must understand by now that ukrainians are willing to fight for as long as it takes to liberate their country he still believes that time is on his side that is because putin expects western governments

cost of their visas if they do not want to pay such a fee for fear that it signals support for ukraine then they can vacation in minsk instead of barcelona the way these new sanctions are announced also matters it is best done all at once by participating countries on february at the same time democracies should make it easier for russians opposed to the war to defect the tens of thousands of russias best and brightest who have already fled should be given work visas to stay in europe and the united states men who fled russia to avoid the draft should be given incentives to not return until the war is over russian opposition leaders and independent journalists living in exile should be able to obtain visas and work permits open bank accounts use credit cards and monetize their youtube channels with much greater ease than can be done todaymoney and messagesukraine needs more money and the west needs to find new ways to provide it the obvious place to start is to transfer the over  billion in russian central bank reserves currently held by the west to the government of ukraine treasury and finance officials in the united states and europe are nervous about such moves but state assets have been seized legally in the past in places such as iraq and afghanistan and it should be done now moreover doing so now has the added advantage of sending a deterrent message to china about invading taiwan as beijing has many more financial reserves invested in the west in addition following the lead of the canadian government frozen assets of russian oligarchs should also be considered for confiscation and transfer to ukraine western countries should impose an import tax on all russian goods and an export tax on all goods and services provided to russia the proceeds of which would be transferred to a ukrainian reconstruction fund and comprehensive planning for the hundreds of billion dollars postwar reconstruction of ukraine should begin todayan effort that should include an international pledging conferenceharsher sanctions work to cut off russia from the world but the west should simultaneously do more to reach the hearts and minds within russia the usgovernmentfunded radio free europeradio liberty nearly tripled its audience most of it in russia and ukraine after the war began russian independent media now operating outside of russia also expanded their audiences viewership of youtube channels operated by colleagues of jailed opposition leader alexei navalny also jumped dramatically in  the two channels navalny originally created have at least  million subscribers but every one of these outlets would benefit from more resources new methods of financing easier access to work visas and technologies to help them penetrate putins informational iron curtain new modalities for reaching russiansbe it through text messaging greater use of tiktok and telegram channels or more subtle cultural messaging rather than direct newsshould be attemptedas long as russian soldiers occupy their country ukrainians will fight they will fight with or without new advanced weapons with or without harsher sanctions with or without money to help them run their country understanding this key insight about the ukrainian mentality today leads to an obvious policy recommendation for the west help ukraine win as fast as possiblethe best way to commemorate february  the anniversary of putins invasion is to make clear that this is the wests strategy this requires a rolloutcoordinated by dozens of countries on the same dayof more and better weapons tougher sanctions new economic assistance greater public diplomacy efforts and a credible commitment to postwar reconstruction this is also the best way to avoid being in the same place when february   rolls around,1

and the love plot over his only desire is to end his own life and to kill as many turks as possible in the process to quote a recent think piece titled decolonizing the mysterious soul of the great russian novel by liubov terekhovaa ukrainian critic who was reassessing anna karenina from the united arab emirates as russia bombed her home city kyivrussia is always waging a war where a man can flee in search of deathliterature in short looks different depending on where you read it a subject i found myself discussing one afternoon over lunch in a garden overlooking tbilisi with anna kats a georgianborn russianspeaking scholar of socialist architecture who immigrated to los angeles as a child we talked about the essay can the postsoviet think by madina tlostanova an uzbekcircassian proponent of decoloniality a theory that originated in latin america around the turn of the millennium a key tenet is that thinking is never placeless or disembodied the first principle of thought isnt as descartes said i think therefore i am but i am where i thinki remembered the first time i read pushkins travelogue journey to arzrum the summer i turned twentyduring my own initial foray into travel writing for a student guidebook i had requested an assignment in russia but my russian wasnt good enough so i was sent to turkey to improve my russian i was reading pushkin on night buses feeling excited every time i saw erzurum pushkins arzrum on the schedule board at intercity stationshow to accumulate vast sums of money is the best trick you ever taught me cartoon by frank cotham share share shop shopturkey hadnt been pushkins firstchoice destination eitherhe had wanted to go to paris denied official permission he resolved to leave the country the only way he could think ofby accompanying the military in the russoturkish war of  the tone of the resulting travelogue fluctuates unsettlingly between chatty verbiage and dispassionate horror the circassians hate us pushkin writes at one point we have forced them out of their open grazing lands their aulsvillageshave been devastated whole tribes have been wiped out nine years after his first visit to the caucasus pushkin seems to have gained some clarity on the circassians plight in  the georgian parliament voted to characterize russias actions there as a genocide still in the next sentence he goes on to observe implausibly that circassian babies wield sabres before they can talk later in his account pushkin describes a lunch with troops during which they see on a facing mountainside the ottoman army retreating from russian cossack reinforcementsleaving behind a decapitated and truncated cossack corpse pushkin quickly segues to the congeniality of camp life at dinner we washed down asiatic shashlik with english beer and champagne chilled in the snows of tauridawhat can we afford to see as writers and as readers could pushkin afford to see that he benefitted from the resettlement of the circassians how clearly could he see it for how long at a timeafter lunch kats and i took a funicular to the top of mt mtatsminda where she maintained that tbilisis best custardfilled doughnuts were to be found rising above the treetops thinking back on my own national and global privileges the extent of which have grown clearer to me with the passing years i did not i decided find it difficult to understand pushkins simultaneous ability and inability to perceive the truththe relationship between literary merit and military power is not a delightful subject for contemplation i prefer to think that i would have loved pushkin even if peter and catherine the great hadnt waged extensive foreign and internal wars dragging russia into the european balance of power but would pushkins work still have been translated into english and stocked in the barnes  noble on route  in northern new jerseyin the world superpower to which my parents came in the seventies in pursuit of the best scientific equipment even if it had been translated and i had read it i might not have recognized it as good would it have been goodin tbilisi i remembered a line from oksana zabuzhkos classic  novel fieldwork in ukrainian sex which i read on my  trip to kyiv even if you did by some miracle produce something in this language knocking out goethes faust  zabuzhko writes of ukrainian it would only lie around the libraries unread her narrator an unnamed ukrainianlanguage poet visiting harvard suffers countless indignities shes broke and her work is rarely translated but she refuses to write in english or in russian a selfidentified nationalistmasochist she remains faithful to her forebears poets who hurled themselves like firelogs into the dying embers of the ukrainian with nothing to fucking show for it but mangled destinies and unread bookswere those books unread because they werent as good as pushkinsor was it perhaps the other way round if a book isnt read and doesnt influence other books will it hold less meaning and resonance for future readers conversely can a good book be written without robust literary institutions eugene onegin is clearly a product of pushkins constant dialogue with the editors friends rivals critics and readers whose words surrounded him even in exile nikolai gogol born in  in ukraine with pushkinscale talents became a famous writer only after moving to st petersburggogol now a central figure in the post discourse about russian literature first found critical success in the capital by writing in russian on ukrainian themes but the same critics who praised him also urged him to write about more universalie more russiansubjects gogol duly produced the petersburg tales and part  of dead souls a celebrated literary hostess once asked gogol whether in his soul he was truly russian or ukrainian in response he demanded tell me am i a saint can i really see all my loathsome faults and launched into a tirade about his faults and also other peoples faults he eventually suffered a spiritual breakdown came to believe that his literary works were sinful burned part of his manuscripts possibly including part  of dead souls stopped eating and died in great pain at fortytwothe kremlin now uses gogols work as evidence that ukraine and russia share a single culture an essay about gogols russianness appears on the web site of the russkiy mir foundation which putin started in  according to a  article by putin gogols books are written in russian bristling with malorussianlittle russianfolk sayings and motifs how can this heritage be divided between russia and ukrainein tbilisi the gogol story i kept coming back to was the nose the one where major kovalyov a midlevel civil servant wakes up one morning with no nose fearing for his job and his marriage prospects he hits the streets of st petersburg searching for his missing proboscis a carriage pulls up nearby a personage emerges wearing a uniform and plumed hat that denote a higher rank than kovalyovs it is kovalyovs nose dont you know where you belong kovalyov demands dont you realize you are my own nose the nose coldly replies my dear fellow you are mistaken i am a person in my own rightread enough putin speeches and kovalyovs attitude toward his nose starts to sound familiar how dare a mere appendage masquerade as an independent entity what cruelty to separate the little russian nose from the great russian face in the nose as in so much of the russian literature that i had been revisiting the interests of empire prevail the police apprehend kovalyovs runaway organ just as it was boarding the stagecoach bound for riga tellingly the nose had been headed westthe morning of my lecture i went for a walk on rustaveli avenue the broad treelined sidewalks were flanked with used booksellers purveying alongside georgian books i couldnt read lone volumes of tolstoy and turgenev at one stall a series of sovietera classroom mapsone of them showing the changing eighteenthcentury borders of the russian and ottoman empireswere held in place by a latvian cookbook and a dostoyevsky omnibusdostoyevsky we meet at last i opened it to crime and punishment the story of raskolnikov a poor student who decides to murder an old pawnbroker to fund his education turning the yellowed pages i noticed multiple mentions of napoleon i thought back on raskolnikovs theory about how extraordinary individuals have the right to kill others for the fulfillment of an idea if napoleon who murdered thousands of egyptian people and stole their archeological treasures is lauded as the founder of egyptology why shouldnt a student be able to kill one person to advance his studies the logic of raskolnikovs crime i realized was the logic of imperialismputins offensive on february  owed much to dostoevskyism oksana zabuzhko wrote in an essay last april after the massacre in bucha she called the invasion an explosion of pure distilled evil and longsuppressed hatred and envy adding  why should you live better than us russian soldiers have been saying to ukrainians it was easy to see that message in crime and punishment why should some ridiculous old hag have money when raskolnikov is poordostoyevsky didnt of course endorse raskolnikovs views the clue is in the title the story ends in a siberian prison still he found his ideas interesting enough to be the subject of a book should we still read that book in culture and imperialism edward said raises a similar question about jane austen he concludes that to jettison mansfield park is to miss an opportunity to see literature as a dynamic network rather than as the isolated experiences of victims and perpetratorsbut that the solution isnt to keep consuming austens novels in a geopolitical vacuum instead we need to find new contrapuntal ways of reading that means seeing mansfield park as a book with two geographies one england richly elaborated the other antigua strenuously resistedyet revealed all the same,1

and martyred is also one of europes most incorrigibly antisemitic countriesso once and for all whats the story with ukraine and antisemitismthe truth is of course that ukraine in the s and s of the th century was a bloodland for jewssoviet ukraine or ukraine sovietized or more precisely ukraine buffeted between sovietism and hitlerism was one of the theaters of the shoah by bullets with counting just the ravines of babi yar  jewish men women and children forced to dig the pits where their warm corpses would be piled still shivering not quite deadand when i say soviet or sovietized its not to minimize the part played in the massacre by compatriots in the countryside or the citiesbut it is to recall that there have been and there are two ukrainesone that was yet to exist as a free and sovereign nation which the ukrainianborn russian poet yevgeny yevtushenko depicted in his requiem to the dead of babi yar as that of the barroom regulars thirsting for the blood of pogroms stinking of vodka and onion and when the victims kicked to the floor begged for mercy encouraging the assassins to beat the yids save russiayes russiaand then another ukraine the one that liberated herself from that russia the one that since the onset of the ussr then the maidan revolution and then the invasion of putins army refuses the status of vassal of the humble twinned servant of the cinderella of the

65,how to get a breakthrough in ukraine nearly a year after he invaded ukraine russian president vladimir putin has failed to achieve any of his major objectives he has not unified the alleged single slavic nation he has not denazified or demilitarized ukraine and he has not stopped nato expansion instead the ukrainian military kept russian troops out of kyiv defended ukraines secondlargest city kharkiv and launched successful counteroffensives in the fall so that by the end of  it had liberated over  percent of the territory previously captured by russian soldiers that year in january putin removed the general in charge of the war in ukraine sergei surovikin whom he had appointed just a few months earlier wartime leaders change their top generals only when they know they are losingukraine is doing so well in part thanks to the unified western response unlike reactions to russias invasion of georgia in  or ukraine in  the western pushback against putins latest war has been strong along multiple fronts nato enhanced its eastern defenses and invited sweden and finland to join the alliance europe has provided shelter to hundreds of thousands of ukrainian refugees led by the biden administration the west has provided massive amounts of military and economic support at amazing speed levied punishing sanctions and begun a difficult shift away from russian energy even chinese leader xi jinping has offered putin only faint rhetorical support for his war he has not provided russia with weapons and has cautiously avoided violating the global sanctions regimethese are the reasons for optimism the bad news however is that the war continues and putin has shown no signs of wanting to end it instead he is planning a major counteroffensive this year the russians are preparing some  fresh troops general valerii zaluzhnyi the commander in chief of ukraines armed forces warned in december i have no doubt they will have another go at kyiv even though putin must understand by now that ukrainians are willing to fight for as long as it takes to liberate their country he still believes that time is on his side that is because putin expects western governments and societies to lose their will and interest to keep helping ukraine if putin or his aides watch the television personality tucker carlson on fox news or saw the protests last fall in prague their hunch about waning western support would be confirmedif russia starts winning on the battlefield or even fights to a stalemate few will remember us president joe bidens remarkable leadership in galvanizing the world to assist ukraine in  this is why western leaders need to shift how they approach the conflict at this stage incrementally expanding military and economic assistance is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely instead in  the united states nato and the democratic world more broadly should aim to support a breakthrough this means more advanced weapons more sanctions against russia and more economic aid to ukraine none of this should be doled out incrementally it needs to be provided swiftly so that ukraine can win decisively on the battlefield this year without greater and immediate support the war will settle into a stalemate which is only to putins advantage in the end the west will be judged by what happened during the last year of the war not by what happened in the firstthe big bang theorythe most important step the united states and nato allies can take this year is to provide ukraine with weapons that will allow its armed forces to go on the offensive sooner and more successfully in eastern ukraine this year started with much encouraging news the united states france and germany announced plans to provide ukraine with infantry fighting vehicles including m bradleys and strykers amx rcs and marders respectively the united kingdom decided to provide a dozen challenger ii tanks and  as mm selfpropelled howitzers the united states and germany announced plans to give ukraine one battery each of the patriot air defense system and the netherlands pledged to contribute patriot missiles and launchers and finally the united states made the decision last week to provide ukraine a few dozen m abrams tanks which paved the way for germany and other european countries to send the coveted germanmade leopard  tanksthis is a strong way to start the year but our support should not stop there ukraine needs more of everything that has already been supplied it especially needs more high mobility artillery rocket systems himars and more guided multiple launch rocket systems gmlr munitions which have proved so effective on the battlefield if more himars are not available then the united states should send m multiple launch rocket systems the more loitering munitions that can be supplied to ukraine the better the number of tanks announced so far is substantial but still falls multiples short of what the ukrainian military needs to push russian occupiers out of their country especially because the abrams tanks will take many months to be built trained on and deployed ukraine could also use several hundred infantry fighting vehicles which number far surpasses those pledged by the united states and other nato allies in january ukraine could also use more patriot batteries national advanced surfacetoair missile systems and other air defense systemsin addition to greater quantities of weapons the united states and its allies should upgrade the quality of weapons being supplied at the top of this list should be the longrange missile system called atacms it fires missiles that can travel nearly  miles and would thus allow ukrainian forces to attack russian airfields and ammunition sites in crimea and elsewhere that are now out of range and offer sanctuary for russian soldiers using longrange weapons to attack ukrainian towns the provision of longrange strike weapons including the groundlaunched small diameter bomb could be a gamechanger in a ukrainian offensive this spring the ukrainian military also needs much stronger offensive air capabilities including sovietmade mig fighter jets and advanced drones such as the us gray eagle and reaper modelsputin still believes that time is on his sideukrainian pilots also should begin training to fly f fighter jets eventually either in later stages of this war or for enhanced deterrence after the war ukraines air force will need to switch from soviet or russianmade planes to us fighter aircraft in return for receiving these weapons ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy could sign a legally binding agreement to not use these weapons to strike targets inside russiathe way this new military assistance is announced also matters rather than providing atacms in march reapers in june and jets in september nato should go for a big bang plans to provide all these systems should be announced on february   the first anniversary of putins invasion an announcement of this size will produce an important psychological effect inside the kremlin and russian society signaling that the west is committed to ukraines ambition to liberate all occupied territories already kremlin propagandists on television lament that they are fighting a wellarmed and rich nato which has greater resources than russia on february  biden and nato allies could fuel this perception that it would be futile for russia to continue its fightrisk calculussoon after the war began many observers including me worried that putin would view the provision of these kinds of offensive weapons as escalatory and yet after deployment of these major weapons systems putin so far still has not escalated the reason is simple putin has no good way of doing so he is already using very expensive cruise missiles to attack apartment buildings he cannot attack nato lest he risk a broader war that russia would lose quickly that leaves him with only the nuclear option but even that would not serve him well everyone agrees that a nuclear attack against the united states or other nato countries is off the table because mutual assured destruction is still in place the probabilities of putin using a tactical nuclear weapon inside ukraine is also very unlikely as it would serve no obvious battlefield objective it would not stop ukrainians from fighting just the opposite they would recommit to defeating russia and even unleash more attacks including covert operations against targets inside russia using a nuclear weapon in ukraine also would rally greater opposition to the war around the world including in beijing within russian society and maybe even among russias generals obviously ukrainians would suffer most from such an attack and yet they are the ones urging the west not to be deterred by putins nuclear blackmailthere are risks to providing more and better weapons to ukraine but there are also risks to not doing so if the war in ukraine drags on for years so many more peopleukrainians first and foremost but also russianswill die stalemate on the battlefield is a euphemism for continued death and destruction this is the cost of incrementalismprotracted war also risks losing public support in the united states and europe at the end of  biden signed into law a new  billion aid package for ukraine this should fund us military assistance until the end of this year including new weapons systems such as atacms and fighter jets should they be given the green light but now that the house of representatives is under republican control future appropriations could be less forthcoming if the war drags through the end of the year without major ukrainian victories the biden administration will struggle to obtain congressional renewal for a new military and economic assistance package especially as the presidential election heats up with at least one major candidate donald trump who is not a fan of aid to ukraine debate over aid will become fiercer in european capitals too if  results in only minor changes on the battlefield the dangers of incrementalism grow over timetightening the visegovernments supporting ukraine also need to dramatically ratchet up sanctions the united states should lead the way by designating the russian federation a state sponsor of terrorism doing so would first amplify american condemnation of russian terrorist acts in ukraine and other countries but there are also practical effects us citizens and companies would no longer be able to engage in financial transactions with the russian government higher scrutiny would be given to transactions with russian stateowned banks stateowned enterprises and governmentrelated individuals controls over exports reexport and transfer of dualuse items would be strengthenedbut a terrorist designation would not close all loopholes the united states together with other countries in the sanctions coalition should enact fullblocking sanctions on all major russian banks such as gazprombank as well as all stateowned enterprisesall of themincluding rosatom russias stateowned nuclear energy company of course exemptions for the financing of russian exports of food and fertilizer should remain but the west must make it more difficult and therefore more expensive for russian companies to transact with the outside worldnew sanctions must be imposed to cut off all critical technologies helping putins war machine from microprocessors needed to build smart weapons to all forms of imported information technology on which the russian government and economy relies the g should reduce the price cap on russian oil exports further from todays  limit to  a barrel and introduce greater penalties for shipping companies insurance agencies and banks that violate the price cap and they must apply more pressure on us and european companies still doing business in or with russia these companies cannot continue to pay taxes to a terrorist state they must leavethe dangers of incrementalism grow over timeindividual sanctions must be expanded dramatically to include all russian oligarchs still not sanctioned but supporting putin all government officials all top managers and board members of the stateowned enterprises all propagandists advocating for the war all russian soldiers fighting in ukraine and the family members of everyone in these categories sanctioning categories of peopleunited russia party members government officials soldiers and so onand not specific individuals has the added advantage of giving russians the option of resigning as a way to get off the sanctions list at a minimum countries involved in the sanctions regime could start expanding their lists to include everyone already identified by ukraines national agency on corruption prevention as deserving of sanctions countries imposing sanctions also must coordinate their activities so that if a russian is sanctioned in one country that person immediately appears on the sanction list of all countries participating in the sanctions regimenew travel restrictions should also be imposed on all russian citizens a complete travel ban to all democratic countries is one option although it risks alienating russians opposed to the war another is to make all russians wanting to travel to democratic countries pay an additional ukrainian reconstruction fee on top of the cost of their visas if they do not want to pay such a fee for fear that it signals support for ukraine then they can vacation in minsk instead of barcelona the way these new sanctions are announced also matters it is best done all at once by participating countries on february at the same time democracies should make it easier for russians opposed to the war to defect the tens of thousands of russias best and brightest who have already fled should be given work visas to stay in europe and the united states men who fled russia to avoid the draft should be given incentives to not return until the war is over russian opposition leaders and independent journalists living in exile should be able to obtain visas and work permits open bank accounts use credit cards and monetize their youtube channels with much greater ease than can be done todaymoney and messagesukraine needs more money and the west needs to find new ways to provide it the obvious place to start is to transfer the over  billion in russian central bank reserves currently held by the west to the government of ukraine treasury and finance officials in the united states and europe are nervous about such moves but state assets have been seized legally in the past in places such as iraq and afghanistan and it should be done now moreover doing so now has the added advantage of sending a deterrent message to china about invading taiwan as beijing has many more financial reserves invested in the west in addition following the lead of the canadian government frozen assets of russian oligarchs should also be considered for confiscation and transfer to ukraine western countries should impose an import tax on all russian goods and an export tax on all goods and services provided to russia the proceeds of which would be transferred to a ukrainian reconstruction fund and comprehensive planning for the hundreds of billion dollars postwar reconstruction of ukraine should begin todayan effort that should include an international pledging conferenceharsher sanctions work to cut off russia from the world but the west should simultaneously do more to reach the hearts and minds within russia the usgovernmentfunded radio free europeradio liberty nearly tripled its audience most of it in russia and ukraine after the war began russian independent media now operating outside of russia also expanded their audiences viewership of youtube channels operated by colleagues of jailed opposition leader alexei navalny also jumped dramatically in  the two channels navalny originally created have at least  million subscribers but every one of these outlets would benefit from more resources new methods of financing easier access to work visas and technologies to help them penetrate putins informational iron curtain new modalities for reaching russiansbe it through text messaging greater use of tiktok and telegram channels or more subtle cultural messaging rather than direct newsshould be attemptedas long as russian soldiers occupy their country ukrainians will fight they will fight with or without new advanced weapons with or without harsher sanctions with or without money to help them run their country understanding this key insight about the ukrainian mentality today leads to an obvious policy recommendation for the west help ukraine win as fast as possiblethe best way to commemorate february  the anniversary of putins invasion is to make clear that this is the wests strategy this requires a rolloutcoordinated by dozens of countries on the same dayof more and better weapons tougher sanctions new economic assistance greater public diplomacy efforts and a credible commitment to postwar reconstruction this is also the best way to avoid being in the same place when february   rolls around,1

just the ravines of babi yar  jewish men women and children forced to dig the pits where their warm corpses would be piled still shivering not quite deadand when i say soviet or sovietized its not to minimize the part played in the massacre by compatriots in the countryside or the citiesbut it is to recall that there have been and there are two ukrainesone that was yet to exist as a free and sovereign nation which the ukrainianborn russian poet yevgeny yevtushenko depicted in his requiem to the dead of babi yar as that of the barroom regulars thirsting for the blood of pogroms stinking of vodka and onion and when the victims kicked to the floor begged for mercy encouraging the assassins to beat the yids save russiayes russiaand then another ukraine the one that liberated herself from that russia the one that since the onset of the ussr then the maidan revolution and then the invasion of putins army refuses the status of vassal of the humble twinned servant of the cinderella of the

flee in search of deathliterature in short looks different depending on where you read it a subject i found myself discussing one afternoon over lunch in a garden overlooking tbilisi with anna kats a georgianborn russianspeaking scholar of socialist architecture who immigrated to los angeles as a child we talked about the essay can the postsoviet think by madina tlostanova an uzbekcircassian proponent of decoloniality a theory that originated in latin america around the turn of the millennium a key tenet is that thinking is never placeless or disembodied the first principle of thought isnt as descartes said i think therefore i am but i am where i thinki remembered the first time i read pushkins travelogue journey to arzrum the summer i turned twentyduring my own initial foray into travel writing for a student guidebook i had requested an assignment in russia but my russian wasnt good enough so i was sent to turkey to improve my russian i was reading pushkin on night buses feeling excited every time i saw erzurum pushkins arzrum on the schedule board at intercity stationshow to accumulate vast sums of money is the best trick you ever taught me cartoon by frank cotham share share shop shopturkey hadnt been pushkins firstchoice destination eitherhe had wanted to go to paris denied official permission he resolved to leave the country the only way he could think ofby accompanying the military in the russoturkish war of  the tone of the resulting travelogue fluctuates unsettlingly between chatty verbiage and dispassionate horror the circassians hate us pushkin writes at one point we have forced them out of their open grazing lands their aulsvillageshave been devastated whole tribes have been wiped out nine years after his first visit to the caucasus pushkin seems to have gained some clarity on the circassians plight in  the georgian parliament voted to characterize russias actions there as a genocide still in the next sentence he goes on to observe implausibly that circassian babies wield sabres before they can talk later in his account pushkin describes a lunch with troops during which they see on a facing mountainside the ottoman army retreating from russian cossack reinforcementsleaving behind a decapitated and truncated cossack corpse pushkin quickly segues to the congeniality of camp life at dinner we washed down asiatic shashlik with english beer and champagne chilled in the snows of tauridawhat can we afford to see as writers and as readers could pushkin afford to see that he benefitted from the resettlement of the circassians how clearly could he see it for how long at a timeafter lunch kats and i took a funicular to the top of mt mtatsminda where she maintained that tbilisis best custardfilled doughnuts were to be found rising above the treetops thinking back on my own national and global privileges the extent of which have grown clearer to me with the passing years i did not i decided find it difficult to understand pushkins simultaneous ability and inability to perceive the truththe relationship between literary merit and military power is not a delightful subject for contemplation i prefer to think that i would have loved pushkin even if peter and catherine the great hadnt waged extensive foreign and internal wars dragging russia into the european balance of power but would pushkins work still have been translated into english and stocked in the barnes  noble on route  in northern new jerseyin the world superpower to which my parents came in the seventies in pursuit of the best scientific equipment even if it had been translated and i had read it i might not have recognized it as good would it have been goodin tbilisi i remembered a line from oksana zabuzhkos classic  novel

fucking show for it but mangled destinies and unread bookswere those books unread because they werent as good as pushkinsor was it perhaps the other way round if a book isnt read and doesnt influence other books will it hold less meaning and resonance for future readers conversely can a good book be written without robust literary institutions eugene onegin is clearly a product of pushkins

also other peoples faults he eventually suffered a spiritual breakdown came to believe that his literary works were sinful burned part of his manuscripts possibly including part  of dead souls stopped eating and died in great pain at fortytwothe kremlin now uses gogols work as evidence that ukraine and russia share a single culture an essay about gogols russianness appears on the web site of the russkiy mir foundation which putin started in  according to a  article by putin gogols books are written in russian bristling with malorussianlittle russianfolk sayings and motifs how can this heritage be divided between russia and ukrainein tbilisi the gogol story i kept coming back to was the nose the one where major kovalyov a midlevel civil servant wakes up one morning with no nose fearing for his job and his marriage prospects he hits the streets of st petersburg searching for his missing proboscis a carriage pulls up nearby a personage emerges wearing a uniform and plumed hat that denote a higher rank than kovalyovs it is kovalyovs nose dont you know where you belong kovalyov demands dont you realize you are my own nose the nose coldly replies my dear fellow you are mistaken i am a person in my own rightread enough putin speeches and kovalyovs attitude toward his nose starts to sound familiar how dare a mere appendage masquerade as an independent entity what cruelty to separate the little russian nose from the great russian face in the nose as in so much of the russian literature that i had been revisiting the interests of empire prevail the police apprehend kovalyovs runaway organ just as it was boarding the stagecoach bound for riga tellingly the nose had been headed westthe morning of my lecture i went for a walk on rustaveli avenue the broad treelined sidewalks were flanked with used booksellers purveying alongside georgian books i couldnt read lone volumes of tolstoy and turgenev at one stall a series of sovietera classroom mapsone of them showing the changing eighteenthcentury borders of the russian and ottoman empireswere held in place by a latvian cookbook and a dostoyevsky omnibusdostoyevsky we meet at last i opened it to crime and punishment the story of raskolnikov a poor student who decides to murder an old pawnbroker to fund his education turning the yellowed pages i noticed multiple mentions of napoleon i thought back on raskolnikovs theory about how extraordinary individuals have the right to kill others for the fulfillment of an idea if napoleon who murdered thousands of egyptian people and stole their archeological treasures is lauded as the founder of egyptology why shouldnt a student be able to kill one person to advance his studies the logic of raskolnikovs crime i realized was the logic of imperialismputins offensive on february  owed much to dostoevskyism oksana zabuzhko wrote in an essay last april after the massacre in bucha she called the invasion an explosion of pure distilled evil and longsuppressed hatred and envy adding  why should you live better than us russian soldiers have been saying to ukrainians it was easy to see that message in crime and punishment why should some ridiculous old hag have money when raskolnikov is poordostoyevsky didnt of course endorse raskolnikovs views the clue is in the title the story ends in a siberian prison still he found his ideas interesting enough to be the subject of a book should we still read that book in culture and imperialism edward said raises a similar question about jane austen he concludes that to jettison mansfield park is to miss an opportunity to see literature as a dynamic network rather than as the isolated experiences of victims and perpetratorsbut that the solution isnt to keep consuming austens novels in a geopolitical vacuum instead we need to find new contrapuntal ways of reading that means seeing mansfield park as a book with two geographies one england richly elaborated the other antigua strenuously resistedyet revealed all the same,1
